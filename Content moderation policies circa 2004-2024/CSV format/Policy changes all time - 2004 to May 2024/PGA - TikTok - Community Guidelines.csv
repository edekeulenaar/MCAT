Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

**More information**

* Providing instructions on how to commit criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property

**Allowed**

* Threats of violence in completely fictional settings (as long as there is no relevance or reference to the real world)

* * *

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members. Our differences should be respected, rather than a cause for division. **We do not allow any hateful behavior, hate speech, or promotion of hateful ideologies.** This includes content that attacks a person or group because of protected attributes, including:

* Caste
* Ethnicity
* National Origin
* Race
* Religion
* Tribe

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute
* Educational and documentary content raising awareness against hate speech

* * *

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

**Violent political organizations** are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

**Hateful organizations** are groups who target people based on protected attributes, including inciting hate, dehumanizing individuals or groups, and promoting hateful ideologies.

**Allowed**

* Discussing a violent political organization (as long as there is no mention of violence)
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness of the harms caused by violent and hateful actors

* * *

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services. If you have had sexual feelings towards a young person, you can connect to [support and resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/prevent-csam/).

### Sexual Exploitation and Gender-Based Violence

We are committed to providing a space that embraces gender equity, supports healthy relationships, and respects intimate privacy. Undermining these values can cause trauma and may lead to physical and psychological harm. **We do not allow sexual exploitation or gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual acts, image-based sexual abuse, sextortion, physical abuse, and sexual harassment.**

If you or someone you know has experienced sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region. If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services. If you believe you have experienced an intimate privacy violation on our platform, you can [report it](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy?lang=en).

**More information**

**Non-consensual sexual acts** refer to any sexual contact that happens without the consent of everyone involved in the activity.

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring our platform is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. **We do not allow human exploitation, including trafficking and smuggling.** We understand how important it is for survivors of human exploitation to share their stories, and for migrants and refugees to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.

**More information**

**Human trafficking** involves earning a profit by exploiting others through the use of fraud, force, or coercion. Considered a form of modern slavery, it can include sex, labor, youth, or organ trafficking, forced marriage, exploitative begging, and the recruitment of youth soldiers.

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

**More information**

**Doxxing** involves publishing personal information about someone online with a malicious intent. We recognize intent can be subjective, so we use objective indicators to help us understand it, such as captions and hashtags.

* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness about the harms of harassment and bullying

* * *

Mental and Behavioral Health

We care deeply about the well-being of our community members and want to be a source of happiness, enrichment, and belonging. We welcome people coming together to find connections, participate in shared experiences, and feel part of a broader community. We work to make sure this occurs in a supportive space that does not negatively impact people’s physical or psychological health.

### Suicide and Self-Harm

We want TikTok to be a place where people can discuss emotionally complex topics in a supportive way without increasing the risk of harm. **We do not allow showing, promoting, or sharing plans for suicide or self-harm.**

If you or someone you know has had thoughts of suicide or self-harm, support is available. Contact a suicide prevention [helpline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/suicide-self-harm/) in your region or your local emergency services.

Content is age-restricted if it shows cosmetic surgery and does not include risk warnings.

Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders, are serious and may be life-threatening. If you or someone you know is experiencing concerns about body image, food, or exercise, support is available. Contact a [helpline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/eating-disorder/) in your region.

### Dangerous Activities and Challenges

We welcome when our community collectively participates in fun and creative trends. Most activities or challenges are appropriate for everyone and bring people together, but some carry a risk of significant injury. **We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities and challenges.** This includes dares, games, tricks, inappropriate use of dangerous tools, eating substances that are harmful to one’s health, or similar activities that may lead to significant physical harm.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply warning information to this type of content. If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

**Significant physical harm** typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.

**Moderate physical harm** is unlikely to require professional medical treatment and does not create a risk of disability or disfigurement. This includes small cuts with minimal blood loss and minor bruising on the body.

Sensitive and Mature Themes

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

* Penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex
* Physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal
* Fetish and kink activity

* Member exclusive content and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)

**Allowed**

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_
* Significant body exposure of young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

* Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts
* Seductive performances by young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

* * *

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Real-world torture, graphic violence, and extreme physical fighting

**Allowed**

* * *

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
* Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health
* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
* Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**FYF** **ineligible**

**Allowed**

* * *

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

* * *

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating the trade of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes

**FYF** **ineligible**

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* **Spam****,** including
    * Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content

    * Accounts that pose as another real person or entity, such as using someone’s name, biographical details, content, or image without disclosing it
    * Presenting as a person or entity that does not exist (a fake persona) with a demonstrated intent to mislead others on the platform
* **Covert influence operations,** including:
    * Attempting to sway public opinion while misleading our platform’s systems or community members about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account

    * Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
    * Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

* * *

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Gambling

Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance. While TikTok is an entertainment platform, we recognize that risking money in a game or a bet may lead to potential harm for some people, including serious financial loss or addiction. **We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.**

**More information**

**Gambling** is betting money (including digital currencies such as bitcoin) or something of monetary value on an event with an uncertain outcome, to try and get a financial gain.

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

### Trade of Regulated Goods and Services

Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. And it is important to understand that these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

### Commercial Disclosures and Paid Promotion

We value authentic viewpoints and want people to be open and honest about any goods or services discussed on our platform. To avoid misleading people, it is important to acknowledge any material relationship with a third party that may be relevant to the crediblity of your statements. **Creators who promote goods or services in return for something of value must disclose it using our [branded content tool](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok) or a caption in video (if the tool is unavailable in your region)**. This includes paid partnerships and brand endorsement. For other types of material relationships, the creator must also make a clear disclosure about such connections in a video caption.

**We do not allow any form of paid political promotion on TikTok.** Learn more about our policy regarding [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

Privacy and Security

We know that protecting your privacy rights and personal information, and keeping our platform secure, are critical to maintaining your trust and ensuring your safety.

### Personal Information

Content shared online may be seen by anyone, and has a wide reach. We are committed to making sure that any personal information shared intentionally or accidentally on TikTok does not lead to harm. **We do not allow content that includes personal information that may create a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation.** This includes content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, October 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed. Account holders must be at least 18 years old to host a livestream or use our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

* Content that shares, reshares, offers to trade or sell, or directs users off platform to obtain or distribute CSAM
* Content that engages with minors in a sexualized way, or otherwise sexualizes a minor (e.g., via product features like duets)
* Content that depicts, solicits, glorifies, or encourages child abuse imagery including nudity, sexualized minors, or sexual activity with minors
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies pedophilia or the sexual assault of a minor
* Content that re-victimized or capitalizes on minor victims of abuse by third party reshares or reenactments of assault or confessions

### Grooming behavior

Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation. These behaviors may include: flattery, requests for contact on or off platform, requests for personal information, solicitation of minor sexual abuse material, sexual solicitations or comments, and gift-giving.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Grooming advances
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies grooming behaviors
* Content that solicits real-world contact between a minor and an adult or between minors with a significant age difference
* Content that displays or offers nudity to minors
* Content that solicits minors to connect with an adult on another platform, website, or other digital space
* Any solicitation of nude imagery or sexual contact, through blackmail or other means of coercion

### Nudity and sexual activity involving minors

Nudity and sexual activity involving minors include content that is overtly revealing of breasts, genitals, anus, or buttocks, or behaviors that mimic, imply, or display sex acts involving minors. We do not allow the depiction, including digitally created or manipulated content, of nudity or sexual activity.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that depicts or implies minor sexual activities including penetrative and non-penetrative sex, oral sex, or intimate kissing
* Content that depicts sexual arousal or sexual stimulation involving a minor
* Content that depicts a sexual fetish involving a minor
* Content that depicts exposed genitals, buttocks, the pubic region, or female nipples of a minor
* Content that contains sexually explicit language depicting or describing a minor

* Content with sexually explicit dancing of a minor, including twerking, breast shaking, pelvic thrusting, or fondling the groin or breasts of oneself or another
* Content depicting a minor undressing
* Content depicting a minor in minimal clothing that is not situationally relevant to the location
* Sexualized comments, emojis, text, or other graphics used to veil or imply nudity or sexual activity of a minor

### Harmful activities by minors

Harmful minor activities include the possession or consumption of substances prohibited for minors, the misuse of legal substances, engagement in illegal activities, and participation in activities, physical challenges, or dares that may threaten the well-being of minors. We remove any such content from our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor
* Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances
* Content that depicts or promotes activities that may jeopardize youth well-being, including physical challenges, dares, or stunts

### Physical and psychological harm of minors

Behaviors that place minors at risk of physical or psychological harm include physical abuse, neglect, child endangerment, and psychological disparagement. We remove any such content from our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that depicts or promotes physical abuse, neglect, endangerment, or psychological disparagement of minors

### Crimes against children

We do not allow users who have been convicted of crimes against children to have an account on our platform. These crimes include: sexual assault, molestation, murder, physical abuse or neglect, abduction, international parental kidnapping, trafficking, exploitation of minors for prostitution, live online sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of minors in the context of travel and tourism, attempts to obtain or distribute CSAM, and the production, possession, or distribution of CSAM. If we discover any such users, we ban the account. Any self-disclosed user information that states the account holder is a pedophile or minor sex offender will be taken at face value and the account will be deleted.

  

Dangerous acts and challenges
-----------------------------

We do not permit users to share content depicting, promoting, normalizing or glorifying dangerous acts that may lead to serious injury or death. We also do not allow content which promotes or endorses collective participation in dangerous or harmful activities that violate any aspect of our Community Guidelines.

We define dangerous acts or other dangerous behavior as activities conducted in a non-professional context or without the necessary skills and safety precautions that may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public. This includes amateur stunts or dangerous challenges.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that shows the potentially inappropriate use of dangerous tools or objects
* Content that depicts dangerous driving behavior
* Content that depicts or promotes ingesting substances that are not meant for consumption and could lead to severe harm
* Content that describes or provides instructional detail on how to perform a dangerous activity
* Dangerous games, dares, challenges, or stunts that might lead to injury or property damage 

  

Suicide, self-harm, and disordered eating
-----------------------------------------

We care deeply about the health and well-being of the individuals who make up our community. We do not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating. However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a [suicide prevention](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/suicide-hotline-resources?lang=en) [hotline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/suicide-self-harm/). In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services.

### Suicide and self-harm

We remove content that depicts suicide, involves suicidal ideation, or that might encourage suicidal or self-injurious behavior. We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

Content that encourages or promotes suicide or self-harm hoaxes are also not allowed. This includes alarming warnings that could cause panic and widespread harm. We will remove such warnings, while allowing content that seeks to dispel panic and promote accurate information about such hoaxes.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual. This prohibition extends to the use of TikTok features. To enable expression about matters of public interest, critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.

Threatening to hack or dox with an intent to harass or blackmail another individual can cause serious emotional distress and other offline harm.

We consider these online behaviors as forms of abuse and do not allow them on our platform.

Hateful behavior
----------------

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

### Attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes

We define hate speech or behavior as content that attacks, threatens, incites violence against, or otherwise dehumanizes an individual or a group on the basis of the following protected attributes:

* Race

Slurs are defined as derogatory terms that are intended to disparage groups or individuals based on any protected attributes listed above. To minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content claiming individuals or groups with protected attributes are physically, mentally, or morally inferior or referring to them as criminals, animals, inanimate objects, or other non-human entities

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Statements of intent to inflict physical injuries on an individual or a group
* Statements or imagery that encourage others to commit or that advocate for violence

### Violent extremist organizations and individuals

We do not allow organizations or individuals on our platform who promote or engage in violence, including terrorist organizations, organized hate groups, criminal organizations, and other non-state armed groups that target civilians.

_Terrorist organizations_

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

_Criminal organizations_

Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery, assault), trafficking (e.g., human, organ, drug, weapons), kidnapping, financial crimes (e.g., extortion, blackmail, fraud, money laundering), or cybercrime.

Integrity and authenticity
--------------------------

We believe that trust forms the foundation of our community. We do not allow activities that may undermine the integrity of our platform or the authenticity of our users. We remove content or accounts that involve spam or fake engagement, impersonation, or misleading information that causes significant harm.

We do allow accounts that are clearly parody, commentary, or fan-based, such as where the username indicates that it is a fan, commentary, or parody account and not affiliated with the subject of the account.

**Do not:**

* Pose as another person or entity by using someone else's name, biographical details, or profile picture in a misleading manner

### Harmful misinformation

Misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false. We will remove misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent. Significant harm includes serious physical injury, illness, or death; severe psychological trauma; large-scale property damage, and the undermining of public trust in civic institutions and processes such as governments, elections, and scientific bodies.

We work to ensure TikTok does not enable activities that violate laws or regulations. We prohibit the trade, sale, promotion, and use of certain regulated goods, as well as the promotion or facilitation of criminal activities, including human exploitation. Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that contains personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) 

  

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence. We do not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

**Do not:**

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users. If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our Community Guidelines, please [let us know](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)  so we can review and take appropriate action."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2022-09-20,"### Community Guidelines

  

  

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, February 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

* Content that shares, reshares, offers to trade or sell, or directs users off platform to obtain or distribute CSAM
* Content that engages with minors in a sexualized way, or otherwise sexualizes a minor (e.g., via product features like duets)
* Content that depicts, solicits, glorifies, or encourages child abuse imagery including nudity, sexualized minors, or sexual activity with minors
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies pedophilia or the sexual assault of a minor
* Content that re-victimized or capitalizes on minor victims of abuse by third party reshares or reenactments of assault or confessions

### Grooming behavior

Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation. These behaviors may include: flattery, requests for contact on or off platform, requests for personal information, solicitation of minor sexual abuse material, sexual solicitations or comments, and gift-giving.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Grooming advances
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies grooming behaviors
* Content that solicits real-world contact between a minor and an adult or between minors with a significant age difference
* Content that displays or offers nudity to minors
* Content that solicits minors to connect with an adult on another platform, website, or other digital space
* Any solicitation of nude imagery or sexual contact, through blackmail or other means of coercion

### Nudity and sexual activity involving minors

Nudity and sexual activity involving minors include content that is overtly revealing of breasts, genitals, anus, or buttocks, or behaviors that mimic, imply, or display sex acts involving minors.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information.

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users.

Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members.

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

**Violent political organizations** are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply warning information to this type of content. If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

**Significant physical harm** typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.

**Moderate physical harm** is unlikely to require professional medical treatment and does not create a risk of disability or disfigurement. This includes small cuts with minimal blood loss and minor bruising on the body.

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

* Penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex
* Physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal
* Fetish and kink activity
* Sexual services, including offering or asking for sexual services (solicitation), sexual chats, imagery, pornography, member exclusive content, and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)

* Member exclusive content and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)

**Allowed**

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_
* Significant body exposure of young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

* Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts
* Seductive performances by young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

* Allusions to sexual activity by adults

**Allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives in some artistic contents, such as song lyrics

* * *

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Real-world torture, graphic violence, and extreme physical fighting

* Body parts that are dismembered, mutilated, charred, burned, or severely injured

* Blood shown in an educational context (such as menstruation) and artistic settings (such as fine art)

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

**Allowed**

* Food-related animal body parts, such as barbecued chicken legs
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness about animal abuse (as long as it does not include graphic content of animal abuse)

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
* Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health
* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
* Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Unverified information related to an emergency or unfolding event where the details are still emerging
* Potential high-harm misinformation while it is undergoing a fact-checking review

**Allowed**

* Statements of personal opinion (as long as it does not include harmful misinformation)

* * *

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

* * *

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating the trade of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

**FYF** **ineligible**

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* **Spam****,** including
    * Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content
    * Operating networks of accounts that represent similar entities or post similar content to lead others to specific locations (on or off-platform), such as other accounts, websites, and businesses
* **Impersonation**, including:
    * Accounts that pose as another real person or entity, such as using someone’s name, biographical details, content, or image without disclosing it
    * Presenting as a person or entity that does not exist (a fake persona) with a demonstrated intent to mislead others on the platform
* **Covert influence operations,** including:
    * Attempting to sway public opinion while misleading our platform’s systems or community members about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account

    * Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
    * Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

* * *

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Gambling

Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance. While TikTok is an entertainment platform, we recognize that risking money in a game or a bet may lead to potential harm for some people, including serious financial loss or addiction. **We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.**

**More information**

**Gambling** is betting money (including digital currencies such as bitcoin) or something of monetary value on an event with an uncertain outcome, to try and get a financial gain.

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

We are committed to making sure that any personal information shared intentionally or accidentally on TikTok does not lead to harm. **We do not allow content that includes personal information that may create a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation.** This includes content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.

If you believe you have experienced a privacy violation, you can [report it](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy?lang=en).

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Personal non-public phone numbers and home addresses
* Financial and payment information, such as bank account and credit card numbers
* Login information, such as usernames and passwords
* Identity documentation, cards, or numbers, such as passports, government-issued identifications, and social security numbers
* Threats or encouragement to share personal information or to hack someone’s account

* * *

### Platform Security

We work hard to protect and secure people and information on TikTok. **We do not allow: (1) access to any part of TikTok through unauthorized methods; (2) attempts to obtain sensitive, confidential, commercial, or personal information; or (3) any abuse of the security, integrity, or reliability of our platform.**

You should avoid clicking on suspicious links or responding to requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, and other personal information. Learn more about our approach to [privacy and security](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/) on the platform.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2022-07-11,"### Community Guidelines

  

  

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, February 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

*   Content that shares, reshares, offers to trade or sell, or directs users off platform to obtain or distribute CSAM
*   Content that engages with minors in a sexualized way, or otherwise sexualizes a minor (e.g., via product features like duets)
*   Content that depicts, solicits, glorifies, or encourages child abuse imagery including nudity, sexualized minors, or sexual activity with minors
*   Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies pedophilia or the sexual assault of a minor
*   Content that re-victimized or capitalizes on minor victims of abuse by third party reshares or reenactments of assault or confessions

### Grooming behavior

Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation. These behaviors may include: flattery, requests for contact on or off platform, requests for personal information, solicitation of minor sexual abuse material, sexual solicitations or comments, and gift-giving.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Grooming advances
*   Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies grooming behaviors
*   Content that solicits real-world contact between a minor and an adult or between minors with a significant age difference

### Nudity and sexual activity involving minors

*   Sexualized comments, emojis, text, or other graphics used to veil or imply nudity or sexual activity of a minor

### Harmful activities by minors

Harmful minor activities include the possession or consumption of substances prohibited for minors, the misuse of legal substances, engagement in illegal activities, and participation in activities, physical challenges, or dares that may threaten the well-being of minors. We remove any such content from our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor
*   Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances
*   Content that depicts or promotes activities that may jeopardize youth well-being, including physical challenges, dares, or stunts

### Physical and psychological harm of minors

Behaviors that place minors at risk of physical or psychological harm include physical abuse, neglect, child endangerment, and psychological disparagement. We remove any such content from our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

We do not allow users who have been convicted of crimes against children to have an account on our platform. These crimes include: sexual assault, molestation, murder, physical abuse or neglect, abduction, international parental kidnapping, trafficking, exploitation of minors for prostitution, live online sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of minors in the context of travel and tourism, attempts to obtain or distribute CSAM, and the production, possession, or distribution of CSAM. If we discover any such users, we ban the account. Any self-disclosed user information that states the account holder is a pedophile or minor sex offender will be taken at face value and the account will be deleted.

  

Dangerous acts and challenges
-----------------------------

We do not permit users to share content depicting, promoting, normalizing or glorifying dangerous acts that may lead to serious injury or death. We also do not allow content which promotes or endorses collective participation in dangerous or harmful activities that violate any aspect of our Community Guidelines.

We define dangerous acts or other dangerous behavior as activities conducted in a non-professional context or without the necessary skills and safety precautions that may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public. This includes amateur stunts or dangerous challenges.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that shows the potentially inappropriate use of dangerous tools or objects
*   Content that depicts dangerous driving behavior
*   Content that depicts or promotes ingesting substances that are not meant for consumption and could lead to severe harm
*   Content that describes or provides instructional detail on how to perform a dangerous activity
*   Dangerous games, dares, challenges, or stunts that might lead to injury or property damage 

  

Suicide, self-harm, and disordered eating
-----------------------------------------

We care deeply about the health and well-being of the individuals who make up our community. We do not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating. However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a [suicide prevention](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/suicide-hotline-resources?lang=en) [hotline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/suicide-self-harm/). In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services.

### Suicide and self-harm

We remove content that depicts suicide, involves suicidal ideation, or that might encourage suicidal or self-injurious behavior. We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

Content that encourages or promotes suicide or self-harm hoaxes are also not allowed. This includes alarming warnings that could cause panic and widespread harm. We will remove such warnings, while allowing content that seeks to dispel panic and promote accurate information about such hoaxes.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide or self-harm
*   Content that provides instructions for suicide or how to engage in self-harm
*   Suicide or self harm games, dares, challenges, pacts, or hoaxes

### Disordered eating

Content that promotes unhealthy eating behaviors or habits that are likely to cause adverse health outcomes is not allowed on the platform. This includes content expressing desire for an eating disorder, sharing tips or coaching on disordered eating, and participation in unhealthy body measurement challenges.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies disordered eating
*   Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies any dangerous weight loss behaviors associated with disordered eating

  

Adult nudity and sexual activities
----------------------------------

We strive to create a platform that feels welcoming and safe. We do not allow nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit content on our platform. We also prohibit content depicting or supporting non-consensual sexual acts, the sharing of non-consensual intimate imagery, and adult sexual solicitation.

### Sexual exploitation

Sexual exploitation is defined as any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, power, or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting monetarily, socially, or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. We do not permit sexually exploitative content.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

Nudity and sexual activity include content that is overtly revealing of breasts, genitals, anus, or buttocks, or behaviors that mimic, imply, or display sex acts. We do not allow depictions, including digitally created or manipulated content, of nudity or sexual activity. We are mindful that some content may be offensive or culturally inappropriate in certain regions or may not be suitable for users of all ages.

Bullying and harassment
-----------------------

We believe in an inclusive community and individual expression without fear of abuse. We do not tolerate members of our community being shamed, bullied, or harassed. Abusive content or behavior can cause severe psychological distress and will be removed from our platform.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual. This prohibition extends to the use of TikTok features. To enable expression about matters of public interest, critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that insults another individual, or disparages an individual on the basis of attributes such as intellect, appearance, personality traits, or hygiene

*   Content that depicts willful harm or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or trolling

Sexual harassment involves unwanted or inappropriate sexual behavior directed at another individual. We do not allow content that glorifies, normalizes or promotes sexual harassment, regardless of the user's intent.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that disparages another person’s sexual activity

*   Content that exposes, or threatens to expose, a person's sexual orientation without their consent

### Threats of hacking, doxxing, and blackmail

Threatening to hack or dox with an intent to harass or blackmail another individual can cause serious emotional distress and other offline harm. We define doxxing as the act of collecting and publishing personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) for malicious purposes. We consider these online behaviors as forms of abuse and do not allow them on our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that threatens to reveal personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), including residential address, private email address, private phone number, bank statement, social security number, or passport number
*   Content that threatens to blackmail an individual or to hack an individual's account
*   Content that incites or encourages others to hack or reveal another person's account, personal data, or personally identifiable information (PII)
*   An individual's account, personal data, or personally identifiable information to encourage others to abuse, troll, or harass that individual

  

Hateful behavior
----------------

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

### Attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes

We define hate speech or behavior as content that attacks, threatens, incites violence against, or otherwise dehumanizes an individual or a group on the basis of the following protected attributes:

*   Religion
*   Caste
*   Sexual orientation
*   Sex
*   Gender
*   Gender identity

Slurs are defined as derogatory terms that are intended to disparage groups or individuals based on any protected attributes listed above. To minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content claiming individuals or groups with protected attributes are physically, mentally, or morally inferior or referring to them as criminals, animals, inanimate objects, or other non-human entities

*   Claims of supremacy over a group of people with reference to other protected attributes
*   Conspiracy theories used to justify hateful ideologies

  

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Statements of intent to inflict physical injuries on an individual or a group
*   Statements or imagery that encourage others to commit or that advocate for violence
*   Conditional or aspirational statements that encourage other people to commit violence

### Violent extremist organizations and individuals

We do not allow organizations or individuals on our platform who promote or engage in violence, including terrorist organizations, organized hate groups, criminal organizations, and other non-state armed groups that target civilians.

_Terrorist organizations_

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

_Criminal organizations_

Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery, assault), trafficking (e.g., human, organ, drug, weapons), kidnapping, financial crimes (e.g., extortion, blackmail, fraud, money laundering), or cybercrime.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that praises, promotes, glorifies, or supports violent acts or extremist organizations or individuals
*   Content that encourages participation in, or intends to recruit individuals to, violent extremist organizations
*   Content with names, symbols, logos, flags, slogans, uniforms, gestures, salutes, illustrations, portraits, songs, music, lyrics, or other objects meant to represent violent extremist organizations or individuals

  

Integrity and authenticity
--------------------------

We believe that trust forms the foundation of our community. We do not allow activities that may undermine the integrity of our platform or the authenticity of our users. We remove content or accounts that involve spam or fake engagement, impersonation, or misleading information that causes significant harm.

### Spam and fake engagement

### Impersonation

We do not allow accounts that pose as another person or entity in a deceptive manner. When we confirm a report of impersonation, we may ask the user to revise the profile or may ban the account. We do allow accounts that are clearly parody, commentary, or fan-based, such as where the username indicates that it is a fan, commentary, or parody account and not affiliated with the subject of the account.

**Do not:**

*   Pose as another person or entity by using someone else's name, biographical details, or profile picture in a misleading manner

### Harmful misinformation

Misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false. We will remove misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent. Significant harm includes serious physical injury, illness, or death; severe psychological trauma; large-scale property damage, and the undermining of public trust in civic institutions and processes such as governments, elections, and scientific bodies. This does not include simply inaccurate information, myths, or commercial or reputational harm.

Illegal activities and regulated goods
--------------------------------------

We work to ensure TikTok does not enable activities that violate laws or regulations. We prohibit the trade, sale, promotion, and use of certain regulated goods, as well as the promotion or facilitation of criminal activities, including human exploitation. Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

### Criminal activities

Criminal activities cover a wide spectrum of acts punishable by law, including theft, assault, human exploitation, counterfeiting, and other harmful behavior. To prevent such behavior from being normalized, imitated, or facilitated, we remove content that promotes or enables criminal activities.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that contains personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) 

  

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence. We do not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform. When it is a threat to public safety, we ban the account and, when warranted, we will report it to relevant legal authorities.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

*   Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

**Do not:**

*   Attempt to access the TikTok platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or misleading versions of the TikTok platform
*   Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users. If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our Community Guidelines, please [let us know](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)  so we can review and take appropriate action."

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, October 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed. Account holders must be at least 18 years old to host a livestream or use our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

### Grooming behavior

Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation.

We remove any such content from our platform.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that depicts or promotes physical abuse, neglect, endangerment, or psychological disparagement of minors

### Crimes against children

We do not allow users who have been convicted of crimes against children to have an account on our platform. These crimes include: sexual assault, molestation, murder, physical abuse or neglect, abduction, international parental kidnapping, trafficking, exploitation of minors for prostitution, live online sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of minors in the context of travel and tourism, attempts to obtain or distribute CSAM, and the production, possession, or distribution of CSAM.

-----------------------------

We do not permit users to share content depicting, promoting, normalizing or glorifying dangerous acts that may lead to serious injury or death. We also do not allow content which promotes or endorses collective participation in dangerous or harmful activities that violate any aspect of our Community Guidelines.

We define dangerous acts or other dangerous behavior as activities conducted in a non-professional context or without the necessary skills and safety precautions that may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public. This includes amateur stunts or dangerous challenges.

We care deeply about the health and well-being of the individuals who make up our community. We do not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating. However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a [suicide prevention](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/suicide-hotline-resources?lang=en) [hotline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/suicide-self-harm/). In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services.

### Suicide and self-harm

We remove content that depicts suicide, involves suicidal ideation, or that might encourage suicidal or self-injurious behavior. We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

Content that encourages or promotes suicide or self-harm hoaxes are also not allowed. This includes alarming warnings that could cause panic and widespread harm. We will remove such warnings, while allowing content that seeks to dispel panic and promote accurate information about such hoaxes.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual. This prohibition extends to the use of TikTok features. To enable expression about matters of public interest, critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.

We consider these online behaviors as forms of abuse and do not allow them on our platform.

Hateful behavior
----------------

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

### Attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes

Slurs are defined as derogatory terms that are intended to disparage groups or individuals based on any protected attributes listed above. To minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Statements of intent to inflict physical injuries on an individual or a group
* Statements or imagery that encourage others to commit or that advocate for violence

### Violent extremist organizations and individuals

We do not allow organizations or individuals on our platform who promote or engage in violence, including terrorist organizations, organized hate groups, criminal organizations, and other non-state armed groups that target civilians.

_Terrorist organizations_

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

_Criminal organizations_

Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery, assault), trafficking (e.g., human, organ, drug, weapons), kidnapping, financial crimes (e.g., extortion, blackmail, fraud, money laundering), or cybercrime.

Integrity and authenticity
--------------------------

We believe that trust forms the foundation of our community. We do not allow activities that may undermine the integrity of our platform or the authenticity of our users. We remove content or accounts that involve spam or fake engagement, impersonation, or misleading information that causes significant harm.

We do allow accounts that are clearly parody, commentary, or fan-based, such as where the username indicates that it is a fan, commentary, or parody account and not affiliated with the subject of the account.

**Do not:**

* Pose as another person or entity by using someone else's name, biographical details, or profile picture in a misleading manner

### Harmful misinformation

Misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false. We will remove misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent. Significant harm includes serious physical injury, illness, or death; severe psychological trauma; large-scale property damage, and the undermining of public trust in civic institutions and processes such as governments, elections, and scientific bodies.

--------------------------------------

We work to ensure TikTok does not enable activities that violate laws or regulations. We prohibit the trade, sale, promotion, and use of certain regulated goods, as well as the promotion or facilitation of criminal activities, including human exploitation. Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

### Criminal activities

Criminal activities cover a wide spectrum of acts punishable by law, including theft, assault, human exploitation, counterfeiting, and other harmful behavior. To prevent such behavior from being normalized, imitated, or facilitated, we remove content that promotes or enables criminal activities.

### Privacy, personal data, and personally identifiable information (PII)

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that contains personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) 

  

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence. We do not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

* Click on suspicious links or engage in requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, or other personal information

  

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users. If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our Community Guidelines, please [let us know](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)  so we can review and take appropriate action."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2022-10-17,"### Community Guidelines

  

_We're updating our livestream policies. Starting on 17 November, 2022, you'll need to be at least 18 years old to host a livestream. You can find our new policies [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines-2022-update)._

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, February 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.

Threatening to hack or dox with an intent to harass or blackmail another individual can cause serious emotional distress and other offline harm.

We consider these online behaviors as forms of abuse and do not allow them on our platform.

----------------

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

### Attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes

Slurs are defined as derogatory terms that are intended to disparage groups or individuals based on any protected attributes listed above. To minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Statements of intent to inflict physical injuries on an individual or a group

We do not allow organizations or individuals on our platform who promote or engage in violence, including terrorist organizations, organized hate groups, criminal organizations, and other non-state armed groups that target civilians.

_Terrorist organizations_

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery, assault), trafficking (e.g., human, organ, drug, weapons), kidnapping, financial crimes (e.g., extortion, blackmail, fraud, money laundering), or cybercrime.

We remove content or accounts that involve spam or fake engagement, impersonation, or misleading information that causes significant harm.

Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence. We do not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

**Do not:**

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

_Last updated, October 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed. Account holders must be at least 18 years old to host a livestream or use our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor.

However, we do support members of our community sharing their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way to raise awareness and find community support. We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a [suicide prevention](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/suicide-hotline-resources?lang=en) [hotline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/suicide-self-harm/).

Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination.

We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited.

**Do not:**

* Attempt to access the TikTok platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or misleading versions of the TikTok platform
* Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform

* Click on suspicious links or engage in requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, or other personal information

  

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users. If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our Community Guidelines, please [let us know](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)  so we can review and take appropriate action."

Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

**More information**

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Threatening or expressing a desire to cause physical injury to a person or a group

* Providing instructions on how to commit criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property

**Allowed**

* Threats of violence in completely fictional settings (as long as there is no relevance or reference to the real world)

* * *

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members. Our differences should be respected, rather than a cause for division. **We do not allow any hateful behavior, hate speech, or promotion of hateful ideologies.** This includes content that attacks a person or group because of protected attributes, including:

* Caste
* Ethnicity
* National Origin
* Race
* Religion
* Tribe

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute
* Promoting any hateful ideology or claiming supremacy over a group of people on the basis of protected attributes

* Facilitating the trade of any items that promote hate speech or hateful ideologies, such as books and clothing with hateful logos

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute
* Educational and documentary content raising awareness against hate speech

* * *

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://scsanctions.un.org/k8946en-all.html), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

**Violent political organizations** are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

**Hateful organizations** are groups who target people based on protected attributes, including inciting hate, dehumanizing individuals or groups, and promoting hateful ideologies.

**Allowed**

* Discussing a violent political organization (as long as there is no mention of violence)
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness of the harms caused by violent and hateful actors

* * *

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services. If you have had sexual feelings towards a young person, you can connect to [support and resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/prevent-csam/).

**Grooming** is when an adult becomes friendly or otherwise builds a trusting relationship with a young person for the purpose of sexual exploitation or abuse.

**Sextortion** is a threat to share nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content without consent, usually to get money, sexual acts, or more nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content.

* Educational and documentary content related to the harms of youth exploitation and abuse (as long as it does not show such content)

* * *

### Sexual Exploitation and Gender-Based Violence

We are committed to providing a space that embraces gender equity, supports healthy relationships, and respects intimate privacy. Undermining these values can cause trauma and may lead to physical and psychological harm. **We do not allow sexual exploitation or gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual acts, image-based sexual abuse, sextortion, physical abuse, and sexual harassment.**

If you or someone you know has experienced sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region. If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services. If you believe you have experienced an intimate privacy violation on our platform, you can [report it](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy?lang=en).

**More information**

**Non-consensual sexual acts** refer to any sexual contact that happens without the consent of everyone involved in the activity.

**Image-based sexual abuse** is the creation, manufacture, or distribution of nude, partially nude, or sexually explicit content without the consent of the person in the content, for the purpose of sexualizing their body, or portraying them in a sexual manner.

**Sextortion** is a threat to share nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content without consent, usually to get money, sexual acts, or more nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content.

### Human Exploitation

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring our platform is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. **We do not allow human exploitation, including trafficking and smuggling.** We understand how important it is for survivors of human exploitation to share their stories, and for migrants and refugees to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.

**More information**

**Human trafficking** involves earning a profit by exploiting others through the use of fraud, force, or coercion. Considered a form of modern slavery, it can include sex, labor, youth, or organ trafficking, forced marriage, exploitative begging, and the recruitment of youth soldiers.

**Human smuggling** involves earning a profit by helping a person to illegally enter another country. It can include providing transportation, consultation, identity, and travel document fraud.

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating or promoting human trafficking and human smuggling activities
* Requesting support for being smuggled illegally into a different country

**Allowed**

* Asking for help to leave a country specifically to escape violence, torture, or other human rights abuses
* Expressing a desire to migrate to another country, or showing a migrant’s journey (as long as it does not explicitly show the involvement of smugglers in their journey)
* Survivors sharing their own experiences of human exploitation
* Educational and documentary content related to the harms of human exploitation

* * *

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

**More information**

**Doxxing** involves publishing personal information about someone online with a malicious intent. We recognize intent can be subjective, so we use objective indicators to help us understand it, such as captions and hashtags.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Degrading someone or expressing disgust on the basis of their personal characteristics or circumstances, such as their physical appearance, intellect, personality traits, and hygiene

Mental and Behavioral Health

We care deeply about the well-being of our community members and want to be a source of happiness, enrichment, and belonging.

Content is age-restricted if it shows cosmetic surgery and does not include risk warnings.

Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders, are serious and may be life-threatening.

### Dangerous Activities and Challenges

We welcome when our community collectively participates in fun and creative trends. Most activities or challenges are appropriate for everyone and bring people together, but some carry a risk of significant injury. **We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities and challenges.** This includes dares, games, tricks, inappropriate use of dangerous tools, eating substances that are harmful to one’s health, or similar activities that may lead to significant physical harm.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply warning information to this type of content. If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

**Significant physical harm** typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.

**Moderate physical harm** is unlikely to require professional medical treatment and does not create a risk of disability or disfigurement. This includes small cuts with minimal blood loss and minor bruising on the body.

Sensitive and Mature Themes

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

* Penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex
* Physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal

**Allowed**

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_

* Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts
* Seductive performances by young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

**More information**

* * *

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location

* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
* Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

* * *

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

* * *

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* **Spam****,** including
    * Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content

    * Presenting as a person or entity that does not exist (a fake persona) with a demonstrated intent to mislead others on the platform
* **Covert influence operations,** including:
    * Attempting to sway public opinion while misleading our platform’s systems or community members about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account

    * Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
    * Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

* * *

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Gambling

Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance. While TikTok is an entertainment platform, we recognize that risking money in a game or a bet may lead to potential harm for some people, including serious financial loss or addiction. **We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.**

**More information**

**Gambling** is betting money (including digital currencies such as bitcoin) or something of monetary value on an event with an uncertain outcome, to try and get a financial gain.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting gambling services, such as casinos, poker, slot games, roulette, lotteries, betting tips, gambling-related software, and apps.

* * *

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

Content is age-restricted and ineligible for the FYF if it shows adults consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or tobacco products.

Learn more about substance use and find information for [treatment, support and recovery resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/substance-support/).

### Firearms and Dangerous Weapons

Firearms and explosive weapons can cause severe injury or death, especially when used in an unsafe manner. **We do not allow the trade of firearms or explosive weapons, or content showing or promoting them if they are not used in a safe or appropriate setting.**

### Trade of Regulated Goods and Services

Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. And it is important to understand that these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

**More information**

**Tobacco products** include vaping products, smokeless and combustible tobacco products, synthetic nicotine products, E-cigarettes, and other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.

**Regulated substances** include prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, compressed air canisters (whippets), and nitrite poppers.

### Commercial Disclosures and Paid Promotion

We value authentic viewpoints and want people to be open and honest about any goods or services discussed on our platform. To avoid misleading people, it is important to acknowledge any material relationship with a third party that may be relevant to the crediblity of your statements. **Creators who promote goods or services in return for something of value must disclose it using our [branded content tool](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok) or a caption in video (if the tool is unavailable in your region)**. This includes paid partnerships and brand endorsement. For other types of material relationships, the creator must also make a clear disclosure about such connections in a video caption.

**We do not allow any form of paid political promotion on TikTok.** Learn more about our policy regarding [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

Privacy and Security

We know that protecting your privacy rights and personal information, and keeping our platform secure, are critical to maintaining your trust and ensuring your safety.

### Personal Information

Content shared online may be seen by anyone, and has a wide reach. We are committed to making sure that any personal information shared intentionally or accidentally on TikTok does not lead to harm. **We do not allow content that includes personal information that may create a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation.** This includes content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.

If you believe you have experienced a privacy violation, you can [report it](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy?lang=en).

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Personal non-public phone numbers and home addresses

* Login information, such as usernames and passwords
* Identity documentation, cards, or numbers, such as passports, government-issued identifications, and social security numbers
* Threats or encouragement to share personal information or to hack someone’s account

* * *

### Platform Security

We work hard to protect and secure people and information on TikTok. **We do not allow: (1) access to any part of TikTok through unauthorized methods; (2) attempts to obtain sensitive, confidential, commercial, or personal information; or (3) any abuse of the security, integrity, or reliability of our platform.**

You should avoid clicking on suspicious links or responding to requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, and other personal information.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2022-10-17,"### Community Guidelines

  

_We're updating our livestream policies. Starting on 23 November, 2022, you'll need to be at least 18 years old to host a livestream. You can find our new policies [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines-2022-update)._

Introduction
------------

_Last updated, February 2022_

TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok.

Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the [tools we provide on TikTok](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines.

We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. (_In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections._)

Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.

At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.

In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.

  

Minor safety
------------

We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities.

Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use). When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging or host a livestream and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions). Account holders who are under the age of 18 cannot send or receive gifts via our virtual gifting features.

### Sexual exploitation of minors

TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

**Do not post, upload, download, stream, or share:**

* Content that shares, reshares, offers to trade or sell, or directs users off platform to obtain or distribute CSAM
* Content that engages with minors in a sexualized way, or otherwise sexualizes a minor (e.g., via product features like duets)
* Content that depicts, solicits, glorifies, or encourages child abuse imagery including nudity, sexualized minors, or sexual activity with minors
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies pedophilia or the sexual assault of a minor
* Content that re-victimized or capitalizes on minor victims of abuse by third party reshares or reenactments of assault or confessions

### Grooming behavior

Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking, or other exploitation. These behaviors may include: flattery, requests for contact on or off platform, requests for personal information, solicitation of minor sexual abuse material, sexual solicitations or comments, and gift-giving.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Grooming advances
* Content that depicts, promotes, normalizes, or glorifies grooming behaviors
* Content that solicits real-world contact between a minor and an adult or between minors with a significant age difference
* Content that displays or offers nudity to minors
* Content that solicits minors to connect with an adult on another platform, website, or other digital space
* Any solicitation of nude imagery or sexual contact, through blackmail or other means of coercion

### Nudity and sexual activity involving minors

Nudity and sexual activity involving minors include content that is overtly revealing of breasts, genitals, anus, or buttocks, or behaviors that mimic, imply, or display sex acts involving minors. We do not allow the depiction, including digitally created or manipulated content, of nudity or sexual activity.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that depicts or implies minor sexual activities including penetrative and non-penetrative sex, oral sex, or intimate kissing
* Content that depicts sexual arousal or sexual stimulation involving a minor
* Content that depicts a sexual fetish involving a minor
* Content that depicts exposed genitals, buttocks, the pubic region, or female nipples of a minor
* Content that contains sexually explicit language depicting or describing a minor
* Content depicting a minor that contains sexually explicit song lyrics
* Content with sexually explicit dancing of a minor, including twerking, breast shaking, pelvic thrusting, or fondling the groin or breasts of oneself or another
* Content depicting a minor undressing
* Content depicting a minor in minimal clothing that is not situationally relevant to the location

We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

### Abusive behavior

We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.

Hateful behavior
----------------

TikTok is a diverse and inclusive community that has no tolerance for discrimination. We do not permit content that contains hate speech or involves hateful behavior, and we remove it from our platform. We ban accounts and/or users that engage in severe or multiple hate speech violations or that are associated with hate speech off the TikTok platform.

### Attacks and slurs on the basis of protected attributes

To minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

Violent extremism
-----------------

We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

### Threats and incitement to violence

We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence. We do not allow threats of violence or incitement to violence on our platform that may result in serious physical harm.

Terrorists and terrorist organizations are non-state actors that threaten violence, use violence, and/or commit serious crimes (such as crimes against humanity) against civilian populations in pursuit of political, religious, ethnic, or ideological objectives.

_Organized hate groups_

We use the term “organized hate” to refer to those individuals and organizations who attack people based on protected attributes, such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or immigration status. We consider attacks to include actions that incite violence or hatred, that aim to dehumanize individuals or groups, or that embrace a hateful ideology.

_Criminal organizations_

Criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groups that have engaged in serious crimes, including violent crimes (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery, assault), trafficking (e.g., human, organ, drug, weapons), kidnapping, financial crimes (e.g., extortion, blackmail, fraud, money laundering), or cybercrime.

Integrity and authenticity

We remove content or accounts that involve spam or fake engagement, impersonation, or misleading information that causes significant harm.

Content may be removed if it relates to activities or goods that are regulated or illegal in the majority of the region or world.

Violent and graphic content
---------------------------

TikTok is a platform that celebrates creativity but not shock value or violence. We do not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.

Copyright and trademark infringement
------------------------------------

Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos) and original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created), although it does not protect underlying ideas or facts. A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies.

**Do not post, upload, stream, or share:**

* Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

  

Platform security
-----------------

A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information.

Ineligible for the For You feed
-------------------------------

The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is [based on](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) [a personalized recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you)[.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you) Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation.

### Minor safety

Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18.

### Dangerous stunts and sports

Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public).

### Overtly sexualized content

We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases).

### Tobacco and alcohol products

TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.

### Violent and graphic content

Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.

### Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content

We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.

### Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content

Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce).

Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users. If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our Community Guidelines, please [let us know](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem)  so we can review and take appropriate action."

Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members.

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://scsanctions.un.org/k8946en-all.html), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

**Significant physical harm** typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.

Sensitive and Mature Themes

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

* Penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex
* Physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal
* Fetish and kink activity
* Sexual services, including offering or asking for sexual services (solicitation), sexual chats, imagery, pornography, member exclusive content, and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)
* Sexual chats, imagery, and pornography
* Member exclusive content and streaming of adult content through a webcam, such as stripping, nude modeling, and masturbation (sexcamming)

**Allowed**

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_
* Significant body exposure of young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

    * women in culturally expected contexts, such as breastfeeding and chestfeeding, at political protests, or at large celebration festivals such as Carnival
* Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts
* Seductive performances by young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

**Allowed**

* * *

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Real-world torture, graphic violence, and extreme physical fighting

* Blood shown in an educational context (such as menstruation) and artistic settings (such as fine art)

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

**Allowed**

* Food-related animal body parts, such as barbecued chicken legs
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness about animal abuse (as long as it does not include graphic content of animal abuse)

* * *

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
* Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health
* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
* Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**FYF** **ineligible**

**Allowed**

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating the trade of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes

**FYF** **ineligible**

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* **Spam****,** including
    * Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content
    * Operating networks of accounts that represent similar entities or post similar content to lead others to specific locations (on or off-platform), such as other accounts, websites, and businesses
* **Impersonation**, including:
    * Accounts that pose as another real person or entity, such as using someone’s name, biographical details, content, or image without disclosing it
    * Presenting as a person or entity that does not exist (a fake persona) with a demonstrated intent to mislead others on the platform
* **Covert influence operations,** including:
    * Attempting to sway public opinion while misleading our platform’s systems or community members about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account

    * Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
    * Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

* * *

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Gambling

Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance. While TikTok is an entertainment platform, we recognize that risking money in a game or a bet may lead to potential harm for some people, including serious financial loss or addiction. **We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.**

**More information**

**Gambling** is betting money (including digital currencies such as bitcoin) or something of monetary value on an event with an uncertain outcome, to try and get a financial gain.

* Promoting gambling services, such as casinos, poker, slot games, roulette, lotteries, betting tips, gambling-related software, and apps.

* * *

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

Content is age-restricted and ineligible for the FYF if it shows adults consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or tobacco products.

### Trade of Regulated Goods and Services

Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. And it is important to understand that these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

We work hard to protect and secure people and information on TikTok. **We do not allow: (1) access to any part of TikTok through unauthorized methods; (2) attempts to obtain sensitive, confidential, commercial, or personal information; or (3) any abuse of the security, integrity, or reliability of our platform.**

You should avoid clicking on suspicious links or responding to requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, and other personal information. Learn more about our approach to [privacy and security](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/) on the platform.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2024-02-27,"Overview

Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

* * *

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

* * *

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

**More information**

**Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including [self-generated CSAM](https://inhope.org/EN/articles/what-is-self-generated-csam). It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexual exploitation of young people, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), grooming, solicitation, and pedophilia
* Physical abuse, neglect, endangerment, and psychological abuse of young people
* Trafficking of young people, promotion or facilitation of underage marriage, and recruitment of child soldiers
* Sexual activity of young people
* Nudity or significant body exposure of young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people
* Seductive performances by young people

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

**Allowed**

* Threats of violence in completely fictional settings (as long as there is no relevance or reference to the real world)

* * *

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members. Our differences should be respected, rather than a cause for division. **We do not allow any hateful behavior, hate speech, or promotion of hateful ideologies.** This includes content that attacks a person or group because of protected attributes, including:

* Caste
* Ethnicity
* National Origin
* Race
* Religion
* Tribe

**Hateful ideologies** are systems of beliefs that exclude, oppress, or otherwise discriminate against individuals based on their protected attributes, such as racial supremacy, misogyny, anti-LGBTQIA+, and antisemitism.

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute
* Promoting any hateful ideology or claiming supremacy over a group of people on the basis of protected attributes

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute
* Educational and documentary content raising awareness against hate speech

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

**Violent political organizations** are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring our platform is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. **We do not allow human exploitation, including trafficking and smuggling.** We understand how important it is for survivors of human exploitation to share their stories, and for migrants and refugees to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.

**More information**

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

**More information**

Mental and Behavioral Health

We care deeply about the well-being of our community members and want to be a source of happiness, enrichment, and belonging. We welcome people coming together to find connections, participate in shared experiences, and feel part of a broader community. We work to make sure this occurs in a supportive space that does not negatively impact people’s physical or psychological health.

### Suicide and Self-Harm

We want TikTok to be a place where people can discuss emotionally complex topics in a supportive way without increasing the risk of harm. **We do not allow showing, promoting, or sharing plans for suicide or self-harm.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows cosmetic surgery and does not include risk warnings.

Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders, are serious and may be life-threatening.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply warning information to this type of content. If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

Sensitive and Mature Themes

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

**Allowed**

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_

* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
* Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health
* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
* Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**FYF** **ineligible**

**Allowed**

* * *

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Unverified claims about the outcome of an election that is still unfolding and may be false or misleading

* * *

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating the trade of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Content that tricks or manipulates others as a way to increase engagement metrics, such as “like-for-like” promises and false incentives for engaging with content

* * *

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo
* Low quality content, such as extremely short clips and exclusively-GIF based videos
* QR codes (unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce)

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* **Spam****,** including
    * Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content
    * Operating networks of accounts that represent similar entities or post similar content to lead others to specific locations (on or off-platform), such as other accounts, websites, and businesses
* **Impersonation**, including:
    * Accounts that pose as another real person or entity, such as using someone’s name, biographical details, content, or image without disclosing it
    * Presenting as a person or entity that does not exist (a fake persona) with a demonstrated intent to mislead others on the platform
* **Covert influence operations,** including:
    * Attempting to sway public opinion while misleading our platform’s systems or community members about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account
* **Circumvention**, including:
    * Attempting to avoid an account ban by spreading content violations across multiple accounts
    * Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
    * Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

* * *

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Gambling

Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance. While TikTok is an entertainment platform, we recognize that risking money in a game or a bet may lead to potential harm for some people, including serious financial loss or addiction. **We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.**

**More information**

**Gambling** is betting money (including digital currencies such as bitcoin) or something of monetary value on an event with an uncertain outcome, to try and get a financial gain.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting gambling services, such as casinos, poker, slot games, roulette, lotteries, betting tips, gambling-related software, and apps.

* * *

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

### Trade of Regulated Goods and Services

Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. And it is important to understand that these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

### Commercial Disclosures and Paid Promotion

We value authentic viewpoints and want people to be open and honest about any goods or services discussed on our platform. To avoid misleading people, it is important to acknowledge any material relationship with a third party that may be relevant to the crediblity of your statements. **Creators who promote goods or services in return for something of value must disclose it using our [branded content tool](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok) or a caption in video (if the tool is unavailable in your region)**.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."
TikTok,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2023-10-18,"Overview

Community Guidelines
====================

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars:

1. **Remove violative content** from the platform that breaks our rules
2. **Age-restrict mature content** so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older)
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards** to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience
4. **Empower our community** with information, tools, and resources

Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!

**More information**

Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice.

1. **Remove violative content.** Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).
2. **Age-restrict mature content.** The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/youth-safety?cgversion=2023).
3. **Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.** The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2023).
4. **Empower our community.** We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our [safety toolkit](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc) helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer [account controls](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy) and in-app features with [safety resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/).

* * *

Community Principles

TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our [commitment to human rights](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/upholding-human-rights/). Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.

### Balance

* **Prevent harm**
* **Enable free expression**

### Dignity

* **Foster civility**
* **Respect local context**
* **Champion inclusion**
* **Protect individual privacy**

### Fairness

* **Provide transparency and consistency**
* **Be fair and just**

**More information**

Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) and the [Santa Clara Principles](https://santaclaraprinciples.org/), and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights/international-bill-human-rights) and the [Convention on the Rights of Children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx). We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully.

1. **Prevent harm:** Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.
2. **Enable free expression:** The creativity unlocked by [expression](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed.
3. **Foster civility:** Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s [inherent dignity](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%201,in%20a%20spirit%20of%20brotherhood.) and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures.
4. **Respect local context:** TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights.
5. **Champion inclusion:** We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of [equal protection](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%207,any%20incitement%20to%20such%20discrimination.), equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6. **Protect individual privacy**: The right to [privacy](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks.) provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy.
7. **Provide transparency and consistency**: Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency). We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion.
8. **Be fair and just:** Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

* * *

Youth Safety and Well-Being

We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. **You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en].). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can [appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok) the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either [in-app](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem/report-a-user) or [online](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy).

Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.

Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to [certain product features](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), (2) developing [Content Levels](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive [default privacy settings](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/privacy-and-safety-settings-for-users-under-age-18), and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF). **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.** You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our [Youth Portal](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/youth-portal) and in our [Guardian’s Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/guardians-guide/).

In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies.

**More information**

**Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including [self-generated CSAM](https://inhope.org/EN/articles/what-is-self-generated-csam). It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

Safety and Civility

Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.

### Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities

We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. **We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.** If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

For details on how we approach content that contains images of or references to violence, see [Shocking and Graphic Content](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/sensitive-mature-themes?cgversion=2023#4).

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Threatening or expressing a desire to cause physical injury to a person or a group
* Promoting or inciting violence, such as making a general call for an attack, encouraging others to attack, and recommending people bring weapons to a location to intimidate others
* Promoting any type of theft, or the criminal destruction of property or the natural environment
* Providing instructions on how to commit criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property

**Allowed**

* Threats of violence in completely fictional settings (as long as there is no relevance or reference to the real world)

* * *

### Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors

TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members. Our differences should be respected, rather than a cause for division. **We do not allow any hateful behavior, hate speech, or promotion of hateful ideologies.** This includes content that attacks a person or group because of protected attributes, including:

* Caste
* Ethnicity
* National Origin
* Race
* Religion
* Tribe
* Immigration Status
* Gender
* Gender Identity
* Sex
* Sexual Orientation
* Disability
* Serious Disease

**More information**

**Hateful ideologies** are systems of beliefs that exclude, oppress, or otherwise discriminate against individuals based on their protected attributes, such as racial supremacy, misogyny, anti-LGBTQIA+, and antisemitism.

**Protected attributes** are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions.

**NOT allowed**

* Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute
* Promoting any hateful ideology or claiming supremacy over a group of people on the basis of protected attributes
* Demeaning someone on the basis of their protected attributes by saying or implying they are physically, mentally, or morally inferior, or calling them degrading terms, such as criminals, animals, and inanimate objects

* Promoting or advertising conversion therapy or related programs that attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity
* Intentionally targeting people who are transgender or gender non-conforming by referring to them using their former name or gender rather than their current name or expressed gender (deadnaming or misgendering)
* Facilitating the trade of any items that promote hate speech or hateful ideologies, such as books and clothing with hateful logos

**Allowed**

* Self-referential slurs used by a member of a group with that particular protected attribute
* Educational and documentary content raising awareness against hate speech

* * *

### Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals

We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. **We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.** These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an [account ban](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023).

Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. **We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.** Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it. We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence.

**More information**

**Violent extremists** are non-state groups, including those [designated by the United Nations](https://scsanctions.un.org/k8946en-all.html), that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons.

**Criminal organizations** are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime.

**Violent political organizations** are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

**Hateful organizations** are groups who target people based on protected attributes, including inciting hate, dehumanizing individuals or groups, and promoting hateful ideologies.

**NOT allowed**

* Accounts operated by organizations or individuals that promote violence or hateful ideologies on or off-platform
* Promoting or materially supporting a violent or hateful organization, including any praise or celebration, or the provision of goods or services
* Promoting or materially supporting any violence committed by a violent political organization
* Promoting or materially supporting individuals who are perpetrators of mass violence or who promote hateful ideologies

**Allowed**

* Discussing a violent political organization (as long as there is no mention of violence)
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness of the harms caused by violent and hateful actors

* * *

### Youth Exploitation and Abuse

TikTok is a place for exploration and learning. Allowing young people to do so safely during their unique phase of development is our priority. **We do not allow youth exploitation and abuse, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), nudity, grooming, sextortion, solicitation, pedophilia, and physical or psychological abuse of young people.** This includes content that is real, fictional, digitally created, and shown in fine art or objects.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we apply an “opt-in” screen to content about survivors discussing their own experiences with youth sexual exploitation or abuse.

We report incidents of youth sexual exploitation and abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ([NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME)). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to a young person’s life or serious physical injury.If you or someone you know has experienced youth sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services. If you have had sexual feelings towards a young person, you can connect to [support and resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/prevent-csam/).

**More information**

**Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including [self-generated CSAM](https://inhope.org/EN/articles/what-is-self-generated-csam). It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body or body parts.

**Grooming** is when an adult becomes friendly or otherwise builds a trusting relationship with a young person for the purpose of sexual exploitation or abuse.

**Sextortion** is a threat to share nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content without consent, usually to get money, sexual acts, or more nude, intimate, or sexually explicit content.

**NOT allowed**

* Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and youth nudity
* Promoting youth sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, and sexual fetishism
* Grooming behavior and sextortion
* Sexual solicitation, including inviting a young person to engage in a sexual act, go off-platform, or share sexually explicit images (even if invited by another young person)
* Promoting pedophilia, such as supporting any form of sexual contact, expressing feelings toward, or endorsing sexual relationships between an adult and young person
* Normalizing pedophilia, such as making jokes about pedophilia
* Showing or promoting physical abuse, neglect, endangerment, and psychological abuse of young people
* Objectifying or sexualizing a young person through images or in-app interaction features, such as making a duet or stitch using a young person’s content that involves imitating sexual acts
* Revictimizing young people who have experienced exploitation and abuse, including through third party reshares or reenactments
* Trafficking of youth, promoting or facilitating underage marriage, and recruiting child soldiers _(learn more about [Human Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#6))_

**Allowed**

* Survivors discussing their own experiences with youth exploitation and abuse
* Educational and documentary content related to the harms of youth exploitation and abuse (as long as it does not show such content)

* * *

### Sexual Exploitation and Gender-Based Violence

We are committed to providing a space that embraces gender equity, supports healthy relationships, and respects intimate privacy.

If you or someone you know has experienced sexual exploitation, support is available. Contact a [helpline or service provider](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/sexual-assault-resources/) in your region.

### Human Exploitation

We are committed to upholding individual human dignity and ensuring our platform is not used to take advantage of vulnerable people. **We do not allow human exploitation, including trafficking and smuggling.** We understand how important it is for survivors of human exploitation to share their stories, and for migrants and refugees to be able to document their journeys, so we provide a space to do so.

**More information**

### Harassment and Bullying

We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We want to ensure that anyone can share their voice without the fear of being degraded or bullied. **We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.** This also includes responding to such acts with retaliatory harassment (but excludes _non_\-harassing counter speech).

We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view. However, we still remove content that violates other policies (such as threats, hate speech, and sexual exploitation), as well as serious forms of harassment (such as doxxing and expressing a desire for someone to experience serious physical harm).

If you or someone you know is being bullied, help is available. We offer [support resources](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/), as well as [tools](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/bullying-prevention/) that can help limit harmful interactions, including restricting options for comments, duet, stitch, and messaging.

**More information**

**Doxxing** involves publishing personal information about someone online with a malicious intent. We recognize intent can be subjective, so we use objective indicators to help us understand it, such as captions and hashtags.

Mental and Behavioral Health

We care deeply about the well-being of our community members and want to be a source of happiness, enrichment, and belonging. We welcome people coming together to find connections, participate in shared experiences, and feel part of a broader community. We work to make sure this occurs in a supportive space that does not negatively impact people’s physical or psychological health.

### Suicide and Self-Harm

We want TikTok to be a place where people can discuss emotionally complex topics in a supportive way without increasing the risk of harm. **We do not allow showing, promoting, or sharing plans for suicide or self-harm.**

If you or someone you know has had thoughts of suicide or self-harm, support is available. Contact a suicide prevention [helpline](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/suicide-self-harm/) in your region or your local emergency services.

Content is age-restricted if it shows cosmetic surgery and does not include risk warnings.

Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders, are serious and may be life-threatening.

### Dangerous Activities and Challenges

We welcome when our community collectively participates in fun and creative trends. Most activities or challenges are appropriate for everyone and bring people together, but some carry a risk of significant injury. **We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities and challenges.** This includes dares, games, tricks, inappropriate use of dangerous tools, eating substances that are harmful to one’s health, or similar activities that may lead to significant physical harm.

Content is age-restricted if it shows activities that are likely to be imitated and may lead to any physical harm. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves activities that are likely to lead to moderate physical harm, or includes professionals who are performing extreme sports and stunts that may endanger others.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply warning information to this type of content. If you see a dangerous activity or challenge, pause for a moment to stop and think before you decide and act. Learn more about [what to do](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/online-challenges/) if you see an online challenge.

**More information**

**Dangerous activities and challenges** include dares, games, tricks, and other acts performed by non-professionals that carry inherent or known risks and which may result in significant physical harm.

**Significant physical harm** typically requires professional medical treatment and creates a risk of temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. This includes dislocated or broken bones, poisoning, loss of consciousness, serious burns, electrocution, concussion, and choking.

**Moderate physical harm** is unlikely to require professional medical treatment and does not create a risk of disability or disfigurement. This includes small cuts with minimal blood loss and minor bruising on the body.

Sensitive and Mature Themes

TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of [respecting local context](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023) and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.

### Sexual Activity and Services

TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation. **We do not allow sexual activity or services.** This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content.

**More information**

**Sexual activity** includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior.

**Fetish and kink behavior** includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

**Reproductive health** refers to physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

**Sex education** refers to a broad variety of topics related to sex, sexuality, sexual health, and relationships.

**NOT allowed**

* Penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, and oral sex
* Physical sexual arousal, including sexual stimulation and physical responses to sexual arousal

**Allowed**

* Reproductive health and sex education content, such as the use of birth control and abortion discussed in an medical way

* * *

### Nudity and Body Exposure

We celebrate all shapes and sizes and want people to feel comfortable in how they present themselves and their bodies. We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity. **We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.** Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.

Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm. **We do not allow significant body exposure of young people.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices.

**More information**

**Nudity** is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.

**Significant body exposure** includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear.

**Moderate body exposure** includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh.

**NOT allowed**

* Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
* Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime _(learn more about CSAM in [Youth Exploitation](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#4))_

* Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
* Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival

* * *

### Sexually Suggestive Content

We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. **We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.** We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.

Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults).

**More information**

**Intent** is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment.

**Seductive performances** involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling.

**Sexualized posing** is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”).

**Allusion to sexual activity** is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

**NOT allowed**

* Sexually explicit narratives, such as vivid descriptions of sexual acts
* Seductive performances by young people
* Allusions to sexual activity by young people

**Age-restricted (18 years and older)**

### Shocking and Graphic Content

Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. **We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.**

Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the [public interest](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/enforcement?cgversion=2023) to view.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we also apply an “opt-in” screen or warning information to some content, such as human or animal blood, wild animals attacking each other, professional fighting, and potentially distressing or mildly graphic material.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

**Allowed**

* Food-related animal body parts, such as barbecued chicken legs
* Educational and documentary content that raises awareness about animal abuse (as long as it does not include graphic content of animal abuse)

* * *

Integrity and Authenticity

We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.

### Misinformation

In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. **We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.** Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on [independent fact-checking partners](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/safety-partners/) and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review.

To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to [reconsider sharing](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share) such content.

**More information**

**Misinformation** includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content.

**Significant harm** includes severe forms of:

* Physical injury and illness, including death
* Psychological trauma
* Large-scale property damage
* Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety

**Conspiracy theories** are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups.

**NOT allowed**

* Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location

* Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it

* Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

* * *

### Civic and Election Integrity

Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us. **We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).** Our [political ads policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts) includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.

We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue. **We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.** This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.

Learn more about [Government, Politician and Political Party accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts), and our [election integrity](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/election-integrity/) work.

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Unverified claims about the outcome of an election that is still unfolding and may be false or misleading

* * *

### Synthetic and Manipulated Media

We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks. **Synthetic or manipulated **media** that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.** This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’.

We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals. **We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.** While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues. **We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.** This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in [Harassment and Bullying](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility?cgversion=2023#7)).

**More information**

**Synthetic media** is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed.

**Realistic scenes** include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real.

**Public figures** are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures.

**NOT allowed**

* Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
* Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
* Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events

**Allowed**

* Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson

* * *

### Fake Engagement

Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting. **We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.** If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes.

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views.

**More information**

**NOT allowed**

* Facilitating the trade of services that artificially increase engagement, such as selling followers or likes
* Providing instructions on how to artificially increase engagement on TikTok

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Content that tricks or manipulates others as a way to increase engagement metrics, such as “like-for-like” promises and false incentives for engaging with content

* * *

### Unoriginal Content and QR Codes

The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. **We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.** If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our [intellectual property (IP) policies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/copyright-policy/en).

Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.

If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a [copyright report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Copyright) or a [trademark report](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/Trademark).

**More information**

**Intellectual property** refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks.

**Copyrights** are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts.

**Trademarks** are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services.

**NOT allowed**

* Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights

**FYF** **ineligible**

* Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo

* * *

### Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors

To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful. **We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.** This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the _account_ name (note that this is different than the @username).

You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes. **We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.** If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.

If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will [ban the account](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2023), and may ban any new accounts that are created.

We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our [advertisement policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advertising-on-tiktok-first-things-to-note?lang=en)).

### Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs

While adults make personal choices about how they engage with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, we recognize that there are risks connected to trading and using these substances. **We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

We also recognize that using these substances can put young people at a heightened risk of harm. **We do not allow showing or promoting young people possessing or consuming alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.**

### Trade of Regulated Goods and Services

Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. And it is important to understand that these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market (Black or Gray markets). **We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.** This includes instructions on how to manufacture regulated substances or firearms.

### Commercial Disclosures and Paid Promotion

We value authentic viewpoints and want people to be open and honest about any goods or services discussed on our platform. To avoid misleading people, it is important to acknowledge any material relationship with a third party that may be relevant to the crediblity of your statements. **Creators who promote goods or services in return for something of value must disclose it using our [branded content tool](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok) or a caption in video (if the tool is unavailable in your region)**.

Privacy and Security

We know that protecting your privacy rights and personal information, and keeping our platform secure, are critical to maintaining your trust and ensuring your safety.

### Personal Information

Content shared online may be seen by anyone, and has a wide reach. We are committed to making sure that any personal information shared intentionally or accidentally on TikTok does not lead to harm. **We do not allow content that includes personal information that may create a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation.** This includes content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.

For You feed Eligibility Standards

The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the [recommendation system](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you?), as well as [tools to help customize](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love) recommendations.

Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to [safeguarding and diversifying](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations) recommendations.

We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents. **We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.** We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.

We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.

Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below.

**More information**

The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above.

It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the [TikTok analytics tool](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/) to track the performance of their videos.

Accounts and Features

### Accounts

**You must be 13 years and older to have an account.** There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate [under 13 TikTok experience](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users), which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy?lang=en). If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.

Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts. **We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.** This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in [Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authencity/?cgversion=2023#6)).

We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a [violent or hateful actor](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/safety-civility/?cgversion=2023#3) or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.

Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to [account enforcement](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

#### Government, Politician, and News Accounts

Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and [free expression](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles/?cgversion=2023). These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to [public interest accounts](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans).

**More information**

**Governments and politicians** include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a [Government, Politician and Political Party account](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/government-politician-and-political-party-accounts).

**News entities** include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:

* Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Promoting or threatening violence
* Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
* Facilitating human trafficking
* Showing real-world torture
* Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines

* * *

### External Links

Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform. **Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines**. If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.

It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.

* * *

### Comments and Direct Messages

Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform. **You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.**

Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages. **A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.**

* * *

### TikTok LIVE

[TikTok LIVE](https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/tiktok-live) allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature. **You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session**.

Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE. **A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban**. Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.

* * *

### Monetization

We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise. **You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.**

Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features. **A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.** Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.

All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the [Branded Content Policy](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-policy), [TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552), [Industry Entry Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9550), and [TikTok Shop Policies](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/policy?content_id=10003962&identity=1). Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

* * *

Enforcement

### Public Interest Exceptions

We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:

* Documentary
* Educational
* Medical and Scientific
* Counterspeech
* Satirical
* Artistic

Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.

We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.

* * *

### Detection and Reporting

We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can [report](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/report-a-problem) violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/).

* * *

### Notice and Appeals

In keeping with our commitment to ensuring [procedural fairness](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/community-principles?cgversion=2023), we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can [appeal the decision](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans#4). You can view the [status of your appeal](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/content-violations-and-bans) in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts."
