Nudity & sexual content policy
==============================
**Note**: On September 7, 2022, we updated our Nudity and sexual content policy to more consistently enforce our Community Guidelines. You can learn more about these changes on [our forum](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/178333446). This policy has been updated with these changes.
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Explicit content that violates this policy could result in channel termination. This policy applies to real-world, dramatized, illustrated, and animated content, including sex scenes, video games, and music.
Don’t post content on YouTube if it shows:
*   The depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification
*   Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Masturbation
*   Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
*   Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
**Note**: The above list isn't complete.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, “pantsing”, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization

Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization

Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured

Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification

*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video encourage sexual arousal, such as by touching of breasts or genitals, or revealing undergarments
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

Nudity & sexual content policies
================================
  
 
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it has any of the items below. Explicit content featuring the below policy violations could result in channel termination.
*   Depiction of genitals, breasts, or buttocks (clothed or unclothed) for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Pornography or depicting sexual acts, genitals, or fetishes for the purpose of sexual gratification on any surface (such as video, text, audio, images)
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Explicit or implied depictions of sex acts for the purpose of sexual gratification 
    *   This applies to real-world or dramatized content such as sex scenes, video games, or music
*   Masturbation, fondling, or groping
*   Masturbation or fondling of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using or displaying sex toys to provide viewers with sexual gratification
*   Animated or illustrated pornography, sex acts, or fetish content
*   Nudity or partial nudity for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.

Nudity & sexual content policies
================================
  
 
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it has any of the items below. Explicit content featuring the below policy violations could result in channel termination.
*   Depiction of genitals, breasts, or buttocks (clothed or unclothed) for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Pornography or depicting sexual acts, genitals, or fetishes for the purpose of sexual gratification on any surface (such as video, text, audio, images)
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Explicit or implied depictions of sex acts for the purpose of sexual gratification 
    *   This applies to real-world or dramatized content such as sex scenes, video games, or music
*   Masturbation, fondling, or groping
*   Masturbation or fondling of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using or displaying sex toys to provide viewers with sexual gratification
*   Animated or illustrated pornography, sex acts, or fetish content
*   Nudity or partial nudity for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

*   Whether the subject's actions in the video encourage sexual arousal, such as by touching of breasts or genitals, or revealing undergarments
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

Nudity & sexual content policy
==============================
**Note**: On September 7, 2022, we updated our Nudity and sexual content policy to more consistently enforce our Community Guidelines. You can learn more about these changes on [our forum](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/178333446). This policy has been updated with these changes.
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Explicit content that violates this policy could result in channel termination. This policy applies to real-world, dramatized, illustrated, and animated content, including sex scenes, video games, and music.
Don’t post content on YouTube if it shows:
*   The depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification
*   Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Masturbation
*   Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
*   Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
**Note**: The above list isn't complete.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, “pantsing”, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

*   Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Masturbation
*   Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
*   Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Non-consensual sex acts or promotion of non-consensual sex acts, such as sexual assault, bestiality, or incest
*   Unwanted sexualization such as non-consensually shared imagery or voyeurism
*   Wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Non-consensual zooming in or prolonged focused or emphasis on the breasts, buttocks or genital area for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
**Note**: The above list isn't complete.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video encourage sexual arousal, such as by touching of breasts or genitals, or revealing undergarments
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).

Nudity & sexual content policy
==============================
**Note**: On September 7, 2022, we updated our Nudity and sexual content policy to more consistently enforce our Community Guidelines. You can learn more about these changes on [our forum](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/178333446). This policy has been updated with these changes.
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Explicit content that violates this policy could result in channel termination. This policy applies to real-world, dramatized, illustrated, and animated content, including sex scenes, video games, and music.
Don’t post content on YouTube if it shows:
*   The depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification
*   Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Masturbation
*   Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
*   Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
**Note**: The above list isn't complete.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, “pantsing”, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

Nudity and sexual content policies
==================================
  
 
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content

*   Depiction of genitals, breasts, or buttocks (clothed or unclothed) for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Pornography or depicting sexual acts, genitals, or fetishes for the purpose of sexual gratification on any surface (such as video, text, audio, images)
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Explicit or implied depictions of sex acts for the purpose of sexual gratification 
    *   This applies to real-world or dramatized content such as sex scenes, video games, or music
*   Masturbation, fondling, or groping
*   Masturbation or fondling of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using or displaying sex toys to provide viewers with sexual gratification
*   Animated or illustrated pornography, sex acts, or fetish content
*   Nudity or partial nudity for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Bestiality or promotion of bestiality
*   Incest or promotion of incest
*   Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
*   Celebrity wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. Remember that [providing context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Please remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd

Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.

*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured

Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification

Educational content
-------------------
We allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. Remember that [providing context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Please remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel.

Please note this is not a complete list.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization

Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie

What this policy means for you
------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Explicit content that violates this policy could result in channel termination. This policy applies to real-world, dramatized, illustrated, and animated content, including sex scenes, video games, and music.
Don’t post content on YouTube if it shows:
*   The depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification
*   Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification
Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------
*   Masturbation
*   Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
*   Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
*   Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Non-consensual sex acts or promotion of non-consensual sex acts, such as sexual assault, bestiality, or incest
*   Unwanted sexualization such as non-consensually shared imagery or voyeurism
*   Wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
*   Non-consensual zooming in or prolonged focused or emphasis on the breasts, buttocks or genital area for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
*   Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
*   Any sexual content involving minors — see our [Child Safety on YouTube](/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information
**Note**: The above list isn't complete.
Age-restricted content
We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video encourage sexual arousal, such as by touching of breasts or genitals, or revealing undergarments
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization

--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel.

If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.
*   Whether breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed) are the focal point of the video
*   Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
*   Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
*   Whether the subject's actions in the video invite sexual activity, such as by kissing, provocative dancing, or fondling
*   Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
*   Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
*   Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts
Please note this is not a complete list.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
Educational content
-------------------
We may allow nudity when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?hl=en) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, pantsing, public masturbation, upskirting, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
More examples
-------------
*   Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
*   Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
*   Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
*   Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization 
    
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel.

Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.

Educational content
-------------------
We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception. 
The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
*   Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
*   Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification
**Note**: The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.
More examples

--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)

We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation.

*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation.

*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Suicide & self-injury policy
============================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.
The websites [findahelpline.com](http://www.findahelpline.com) and [www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_suicide\_crisis\_lines](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) could help you find organizations for regions not listed here.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)

In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)

YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community.

You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)

Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community.

You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

Suicide & self-injury policy
============================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community.

You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community.

At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content

If you believe someone is in danger:

*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.

*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)

You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Please note this is not a complete list.
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.
The websites [findahelpline.com](http://www.findahelpline.com) and [www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_suicide\_crisis\_lines](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) could help you find organizations for regions not listed here.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Please note this is not a complete list.
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Suicide & self-injury policy
============================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of suicide prevention organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. The websites [www.befrienders.org](https://www.befrienders.org/) and [suicide.org](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html) also have extensive lists of organizations.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured

*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation.

Suicide & self-injury
=====================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.

*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.

What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone.

It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Suicide & self-harm policy
==========================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, that is intended to shock or disgust, or poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, or self-harm related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might self-harm or experience suicidal thinking. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.
Below is a list of organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. These are recognized crisis service partners. Partnerships vary by country/region.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

Suicide & self-injury
=====================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.
We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)

Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers

================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895).
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way. 
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content. 
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms. 
#### Don't post the following content: 
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide or self-harm
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide or engage in self-harm
*   Content related to suicide or self-harm that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Blurred imagery in combination with details or visuals that show the method of suicide
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide and self-harm content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Avoid showing the suicide victim, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895)
*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope
*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).
Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)
### **Warnings and supportive resources**
YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example: 
*   A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
*   A [panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred and doesn’t provide details or visuals of the method used to perform suicide or self-harm
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm
We recommend using these best practices to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

*   Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope

*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652)

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users.

To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic

Community Guidelines for posting suicide or self-harm related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, and self-harm in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide or self-harm related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide or self-harm. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:

*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)

Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest

*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide or self-harm

​Suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders policy
================================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
**Note**: On April 18, 2023, we updated our Eating disorders policy to better protect the community from sensitive content that may pose a risk to some audiences. We may remove imitable content, age-restrict content, or show a crisis resource panel on videos about eating disorders or self-harm topics. The below policy is updated with these changes. You can learn more about our approach in [this blog post](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/).
At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.
However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.
What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------
If you believe someone is in danger:
*   Get in touch with local emergency services for help
*   [Flag the video](/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention
If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.
For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.
What to do if you need support
------------------------------
If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.
However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.
To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060).
This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
#### Don't post the following content:
*   Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
*   Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
*   Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
*   Graphic images of self-harm
*   Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
*   Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
*   Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](/youtube/answer/6345162)
*   Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders
In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video). Please note this is not a complete list:
*   Content that is meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic
*   Content that is of public interest
*   Graphic content that is sufficiently blurred
*   Dramatizations or scripted content, which includes but is not limited to animations, video games, music videos, and clips from movies and shows
*   Detailed discussion of suicide or self-harm methods, locations and hotspots
*   Graphic descriptions of self-harm or suicide
*   Eating disorder recovery content that includes details which may be triggering to at-risk viewers
### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

*   Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
*   Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
*   Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

*   Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652).
We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:
*   Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
*   Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
*   Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
