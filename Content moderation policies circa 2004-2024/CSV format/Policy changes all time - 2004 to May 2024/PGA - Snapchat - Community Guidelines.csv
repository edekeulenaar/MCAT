Snapchat,Community Guidelines,n.a.,2023-01-11,"Community Guidelines

Updated: January 18, 2022

At Snap, we contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. We created these Community Guidelines to support our mission by encouraging the broadest range of self-expression, while making sure Snapchatters can use our services safely every day. We intend for these Guidelines to be clear and understandable for all members of our community. 

These Guidelines apply to all content (which includes all forms of communication, like text, images, links or attachments, emojis and creative tools) on Snapchat — and to all Snapchatters, equally. Advertisers and media partners in Discover agree to additional guidelines, including the requirement that their content is accurate and, where appropriate, fact-checked. In certain cases, we won’t take action against content when it is newsworthy, factual, and relates to a matter of political, social, or other general concern to our community.

We've outlined here and in our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms) specific rules for content that is prohibited on Snapchat. But it's hard to anticipate every situation that might come up. The key is the spirit of these rules: we want Snapchat to be a safe and positive experience for everyone. We reserve the right to decide, in our sole discretion, what content violates that spirit and will not be permitted on the platform.

Sexually Explicit Content

* We prohibit accounts that promote or distribute pornographic content.
    
* We report all instances of child sexual exploitation to authorities. Never post, save, or send nude or sexually explicit content involving anyone under the age of 18 — even of yourself. Never ask a minor to send sexually explicit content.
    
* Breastfeeding and other depictions of nudity in certain non-sexual contexts may be permitted.
    

Harassment & Bullying

* We prohibit bullying or harassment of any kind. If someone blocks you, you may not contact them from another account.
    
* Sharing another person’s private information and Snaps of people in private spaces — like a bathroom, bedroom, locker room or a medical facility — without their knowledge and consent is not allowed.
    
* If someone is depicted in your Snap and asks you to remove it, please do! Respect the privacy rights of others.
    

Threats, Violence & Harm

* Encouraging violence or dangerous behavior is prohibited — never intimidate or threaten to harm a person, a group of people, or someone’s property.
    
* Snaps of gratuitous or graphic violence, including animal abuse are not allowed.
    
* We don’t allow the glorification of self-harm, including the promotion of self-injury, suicide or eating disorders
    

Impersonation, Deceptive Practices & False Information

* We prohibit pretending to be someone (or something) that you’re not, or attempting to deceive people about who you are. This includes impersonating your friends, celebrities, brands, or other organizations.
    
* We prohibit spreading false information that causes harm or is malicious, such as denying the existence of tragic events, unsubstantiated medical claims, undermining the integrity of civic processes, or manipulating content for false or misleading purposes.
    
* We disallow spam and deceptive practices, including imitating Snapchat or Snap Inc.
    

Illegal Activity

* Don’t use Snapchat for any illegal activity — including to promote criminal activity; facilitate or participate in cybercrime; or to buy, sell or facilitate sales of illegal or regulated drugs, contraband, weapons, and counterfeit goods or documents.

Updated: August 2023

At Snap, we contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. We created these Community Guidelines to support our mission by encouraging the broadest range of self-expression, while striving to make sure Snapchatters can use our services safely every day. We intend for these Guidelines to be clear and understandable for all members of our community. Please note that in order to join our community, you must be at least 13 years old. 

These Guidelines apply to all content (which includes all forms of communication, like text, images, generative AI, links or attachments, emojis, Lenses and other creative tools) or behavior on Snapchat — and to all Snapchatters. We are particularly sensitive to content or behavior that poses a risk of severe harm to Snapchatters, and reserve the right to take immediate, permanent action against users engaging in such behavior. Additional guidance about what we consider to be severe harm and how we take action against it is available [here](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/severe-harm). 

Advertisers and media partners in Discover agree to additional guidelines, including the requirement that their content is accurate and, where appropriate, fact-checked. Developers are also subject to additional rules. We also implement safeguards to help keep generative AI content in line with our Community Guidelines. 

We've outlined here and in our [Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms) specific rules for content that is prohibited on Snapchat, and we work to ensure these rules are applied consistently. When applying these rules, we take into account the nature of the content, including whether it is newsworthy, factual, and relates to a matter of political, social, or other general concern to our community. Additional context about how we moderate content and enforce our policies is available [here](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation). We also provide links to more detailed information about our Community Guidelines throughout each of the sections below.
