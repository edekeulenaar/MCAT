Spam, deceptive practices & scams policies
==========================================

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.

If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

*   **Video Spam**: Content that is excessively posted, repetitive, or untargeted and does one or more of the following:
    *   Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.
    *   Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.
    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.
*   **Misleading Metadata or Thumbnails**: Using the title, thumbnails, description, or tags to trick users into believing the content is something it is not.

*   **Scams**: Content offering cash gifts, “get rich quick” schemes, or pyramid schemes (sending money without a tangible product in a pyramid structure).
*   **Voter Suppression**: Content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting.

*   **Repetitive comments**: Leaving large amounts of identical, untargeted or repetitive comments.
*   **Live Stream Abuse**: Live streams intended to stream content that belongs to somebody else and are not corrected following repeated warnings of possible abuse. Live streams should be actively monitored by the channel owner, and any potential issues should be corrected in a timely manner.
