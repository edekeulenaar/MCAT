Misinformation policies
=======================

Certain types of misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm are not allowed on YouTube. This includes certain types of misinformation that can cause real-world harm, like promoting harmful remedies or treatments, certain types of technically manipulated content, or content interfering with democratic processes.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions below.

*   **Promoting dangerous remedies or cures:** Content that claims that harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits.
*   **Suppression of census participation:** Content aiming to mislead census participants about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements of the census, or false claims that could materially discourage census participation.
*   **Manipulated content:** Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.
*   **Misattributed content:** Content that may pose a serious risk of egregious harm by falsely claiming that old footage from a past event is from a current event.

*   Videos that have been technically manipulated (beyond clips taken out of context) to make it appear that a government official is dead.
*   Video content that has been technically manipulated (beyond clips taken out of context) to fabricate events where there’s a serious risk of egregious harm.

Misattributed content

*   Content inaccurately presented as documenting human rights abuses in a specific location that is actually content from another location or event.  
*   Content showing a military crackdown on protesters with false claims that the content is from a current event, when the footage is actually several years old.

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
