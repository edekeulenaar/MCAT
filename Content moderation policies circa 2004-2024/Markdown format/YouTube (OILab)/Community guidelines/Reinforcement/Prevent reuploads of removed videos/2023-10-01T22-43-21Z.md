       # Prevent reuploads of removed videos

If your [copyright-protected](/youtube/answer/2797466) work was posted on YouTube without authorization, you can [submit a copyright removal request](/youtube/answer/2807622). If you submit a removal request using our [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form), you can select the option to prevent copies of the videos from being uploaded again.


Selecting this option means YouTube will make its best efforts to automatically prevent copies of the videos you’re requesting for removal from being reuploaded in the future. Keep in mind your removal request must be found to be complete and valid before any videos are removed or any copies are prevented from being reuploaded.




Abuse of this feature may result in you losing the ability to use it for future removal requests. Misuse of the [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form), such as submitting false information, may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

## Selecting the Prevent Copies option


Before selecting the **Prevent Copies** option, make sure you own exclusive worldwide rights to the videos you’re reporting in your removal request. To select the **Prevent Copies** option:


1. Start filling out the [copyright removal request webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form).
2. Under **Removal options**, check the box next to "Prevent copies of these videos from appearing on YouTube going forward."
3. Click **SUBMIT** when you’re done filling out the form.
	* **Note**: Your removal request must be approved before our system starts to find and prevent copies from being uploaded.




* You can also get to the webform from the **Copyright** page of [YouTube Studio](http://studio.youtube.com/). In the **Removal Requests** tab, click **NEW REMOVAL REQUEST**.
* In some cases, we may also prevent the reupload of a copy of a video previously removed for copyright infringement even if you haven’t selected the Prevent Copies option.

## FAQs


### If you submitted a copyright removal request:


## I forgot to select “Prevent Copies” when I submitted my removal request. Can I go back and select it?


If you didn’t initially select the **Prevent Copies** option, you can't select it for a removal request you already submitted. If you find another video that violates your copyright, use the [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form) to submit a new removal request. Be sure to select the **Prevent Copies** option before you submit.
## Why am I not seeing any videos that were automatically prevented from reupload?



You might not see any copies of videos automatically prevented from reupload if:


* Your removal request has not been approved.
* No copies of the removed videos have been identified.



## I selected the “Prevent Copies” option, but found a copy of my video that wasn’t automatically removed. Why wasn’t it caught?



The **Prevent Copies** feature makes its best efforts to prevent copies of the removed videos from being reuploaded. The feature takes effect after your removal request is approved. It’s possible the copy you found may have been uploaded before it was approved.


Also, if someone uses a short clip of your video, their video won’t be automatically prevented from being uploaded because our system doesn’t consider it to be a copy of the removed video.


If you found a copy of a removed video, you can report it using our [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form). You can also check if the video you found shows up in your [Matches](/youtube/answer/7648743#review_matches) tab and submit a removal request from there.



## What’s the difference between the “Automatically prevented” column and the “Find matches” column?



The **Automatically prevented** column shows the number of **copies** of a removed video. These videos were automatically prevented from appearing on YouTube when a user tried to upload them.


When the **Automatically prevented** status is **Active**, it means YouTube is actively making its best efforts to prevent others from uploading these copies.


The **Find matches** column indicates whether YouTube is searching for potential copies of a removed video.


When the **Find matches** status is **Active,** it means YouTube is actively searching for potential copies of removed videos. These potential copies weren’t automatically prevented from upload because they weren’t identified as copies, but are considered potential copies.


**Note**: The status of these columns can show as **Inactive** when your removal request becomes inactive. This can happen if you’ve [retracted](/youtube/answer/2807691) your removal request or if a video was reinstated as a result of a [counter notification](/youtube/answer/2807684).



## Why isn’t every video that uses my content prevented from upload, including videos that aren’t identified as copies?



Not every use of your content may infringe on your copyright. There are copyright exceptions like [fair use](/youtube/answer/9783148?hl=en), which could mean a use of your content may be valid.


Our system will show you potential copies of removed videos, but it’s up to you to decide what action to take. If you believe a potential copy violates your copyright, you can submit a [removal request](http://youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form) for that potential copy.



## Why can’t I find out which individual copies were automatically prevented from upload?



Since these videos weren’t uploaded, there’s no action for you to take. The running count of videos shown in the **Automatically prevented** column will give you an idea of how many copies were prevented from being reuploaded.



## If a copy of a removed video is set as private, will it be prevented from upload?



Regardless of privacy settings, our system will make its best effort to identify copies of removed videos and automatically prevent them from being reuploaded.


For matches that need your review, we’ll only surface videos that are publicly available.



## Will the "Prevent Copies" feature automatically prevent videos that include my copyrighted non-video content, such as an image?



Yes, the **Prevent Copies** feature can prevent copies and surface potential copies if your copyrighted non-video content is located in a video.


Keep in mind, our system only checks videos uploaded to YouTube. If your non-video content is located in a description or thumbnail image, or anywhere that's not in the video itself, our system won't be able to identify it.



## What does it mean to have worldwide exclusive rights to the content I’m requesting the removal of?



Having worldwide exclusive rights means that only you, or the client you represent, control the use and distribution of the content worldwide.



## Why can’t I get access to Content ID?



YouTube’s [copyright management tools](/youtube/answer/9245819) are designed for different types of creators, from occasional uploaders to established media companies. Content ID is available to copyright owners with the most complex copyright management needs.


To qualify for Content ID, copyright owners must own exclusive rights to a substantial body of original material that is frequently uploaded to YouTube. They must also have an advanced knowledge of copyright and the resources necessary to manage Content ID, among other criteria. Learn more about [Content ID eligibility](/youtube/answer/1311402).



## I’m a musician. Can I use this feature to find reuploads of my songs?



The **Prevent Copies** feature only prevents new copies of videos you removed through the [copyright removal process](/youtube/answer/2807622). If you find a video that uses your song or audio content without permission, you can always report it using our [copyright removal request webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form).


Once you submit a successful removal request using the webform, the [Copyright Match Tool](/youtube/answer/7648743) will surface videos with audio that could potentially match your song or audio content. Keep in mind that, if someone used a portion of your song or audio content in their video, it won’t be surfaced by the Copyright Match Tool.



### If your video was prevented from being uploaded:


## Where can I get more info about why my video was prevented from being uploaded?



You can find more info in [YouTube Studio](http://studio.youtube.com):


1. From the left menu, select **Content**.
2. In the **Restrictions** column, hover over **Terms and policies**. The pop-up will tell you that your video could not be uploaded as it is a copy of a video we’ve previously removed due to a copyright removal request. It will show you who issued the copyright removal request, when the request was received, and the title of the claimant's copyright-protected work.


We’ll also send you an email when your video is prevented from being uploaded, which will include this info.



## If one of my videos was prevented from being uploaded, does that mean I get a copyright strike?


No, if a video is automatically prevented from being uploaded, it doesn’t affect your channel and won’t result in [copyright strikes](/youtube/answer/2814000) or [Community Guidelines strikes](/youtube/answer/2802032).
## If I believe my video should be uploaded, what can I do?



If you believe your video should be uploaded, you can file an appeal using the link in the popup.


In your appeal, you should provide us with:


1. **Your contact information**


If YouTube accepts your appeal, we will forward it to the claimant who submitted the copyright removal request, including your personal information. They may use this information to contact you regarding your appeal. If you are concerned about sharing your personal information with the claimant, you may appoint an authorized representative (such as an attorney) to submit appeals on your behalf. The authorized representative must use their own YouTube account to submit the request. Also, they need to specify their relationship to you.


2. **Valid video URL of the video that was prevented from being uploaded**


This should appear automatically upon clicking the link in the popup to file an appeal.


3. **Why you believe you have all necessary rights to upload the video**


In your own words, explain why you have all necessary rights to upload the video, and attach supporting documentation. This will go to the claimant for review.


4. **Statements**


You must agree to the following 2 statements:


* *I declare that I have all necessary rights to upload the content in question to YouTube.*
* *I declare that the information in this appeal is true and complete. I understand that filing an appeal containing false information may result in the termination of my YouTube account.*


5. **Your Signature**


Typing your, or your authorized representative’s (where applicable), full legal name would act as a digital signature. A full legal name should be a first and last name, not a company or channel name.
