Content that aims to encourage dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death is not allowed on YouTube.

If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you find many videos, comments, or a creator's entire channel that you wish to report, visit our [reporting tool](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

Age-restricted content
----------------------

We may consider the following factors when determining whether to age-restrict or remove content. Please note this is not a complete list.

*   Whether the act in question could lead to serious injury or death.
*   Whether the individuals participating in the act are trained professionals taking precautions to prevent injury.
*   Whether the act could be easily imitated by minors.
*   Whether the content could be used to commit serious acts of violence.
*   Whether the upload is educational, documentary, scientific or artistic in nature.
*   Whether there's any commentary discouraging the act. 
*   Whether the viewer can tell if it's real or fake. 

**Examples of age-restricted content**

*    A video about fake harmful pranks that seems so real that viewers can't tell the difference. 
*   A reaction video to a dangerous challenge without any commentary discouraging the challenge. 

A video that depicts dangerous acts may be allowed if the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA), and it isn’t gratuitously graphic. For example, a news piece on the dangers of choking games would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context from the same documentary might not be.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.
