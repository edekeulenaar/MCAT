       # Vulgar language policy

Some language may not be appropriate for viewers under 18. We may consider the following factors when deciding whether to age-restrict, remove content, or issue a strike on the channel.


* Use of sexually explicit language or narratives
* Use of excessive profanity in your video
* Use of heavy profanity or sexually suggestive terms in your video’s title, thumbnail, or associated metadata
* Use of excessive sexual sounds


**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.


### Examples


Here are some examples of content that may be age-restricted:


* A video focused on the use of profanities, like a compilation or clip taken out of context
* A video that features road rage or a sustained rant with heavy profanities
* A video that features the use of heavy profanities during a physical confrontation or to describe acts of violence
