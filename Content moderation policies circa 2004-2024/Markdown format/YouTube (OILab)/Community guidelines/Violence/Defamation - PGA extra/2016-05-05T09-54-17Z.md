    # Defamation

Defamation laws vary from country to country but usually concern content that damages the reputation of another person or business. Although the definition of defamation varies around the world, in general, **defamation** is any untrue statement that is harmful to someone's reputation or causes someone to be shunned or avoided.


We take into account local legal considerations in our defamation blocking process, and in some cases, we require a court order. For us to be able to process a defamation blocking request, the claim needs to be specific and strongly supported. For example, it needs to explain why you believe the statements are untrue and how it damages your reputation.


In some cases, uploaders willingly remove harmful content. Because obtaining a court order can be costly and time-consuming, we encourage users to contact the uploaders of the content in question directly.


If you are unable to reach the uploader, consider whether the video meets the standards for removal under our [privacy or harassment policy](https://www.youtube.com/reportabuse). 


If you've attempted to contact the uploader, and you believe a defamation claim is more appropriate than a privacy or harassment complaint, please fill out the webform.

Please note, abuse of our legal forms may result in termination of your YouTube account.
