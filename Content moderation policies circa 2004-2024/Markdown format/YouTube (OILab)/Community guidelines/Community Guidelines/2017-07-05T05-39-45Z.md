![Respect the YouTube community](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-communityguidelines-respect.png)


## Respect the YouTube community




 We're not asking for the kind of respect reserved for nuns, the elderly and
 brain surgeons. All we ask is that you don't abuse the site. Every cool, new
 community feature on YouTube involves a certain level of trust. We trust you
 to be responsible, and millions of users respect that trust. Please be one of
 them.
 







## Don't cross the line




 Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble.
 Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look
 for loopholes or attempt to weasel your way out of the guidelines â just
 understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
 





![Nudity or sexual content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-nudity.png)



 Nudity or sexual content
 


 YouTube is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this
 describes your video, even if it's a video of yourself, don't post it
 on YouTube. Also, please be advised that we work closely with law
 enforcement agencies and that we report child exploitation. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802002)








![Violent or graphic content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-violence.png)



 Violent or graphic content
 


 It's not acceptable to post violent or gory content that is primarily
 intended to be shocking, sensational or disrespectful. If you post
 graphic content in a news or documentary context, please provide
 enough information to help people understand what's going on in the
 video. Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.

![Hateful content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-hateful.png)



 Hateful content
 


 Our products are platforms for free expression. However, we don't
 support content that promotes or condones violence against
 individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion,
 disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status or sexual
 orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting
 hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a
 delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a
 protected group, the content crosses the line. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939)








![Spam, misleading metadata and scams](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-spam.png)



 Spam, misleading metadata and scams
 


 Everyone hates spam. Don't create misleading descriptions, tags,
 titles or thumbnails in order to increase views. It's not acceptable
 to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content,
 including comments and private messages. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973)










![Harmful or dangerous content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-harmful.png)



 Harmful or dangerous content
 


 Don't post videos that encourage others to do things that might cause
 them to get badly hurt, especially children. Videos showing such
 harmful or dangerous acts may be age-restricted or removed depending
 on their severity. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964)








![Copyright](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-copyright.png)



 Copyright
 


 Respect copyright. Only upload videos that you made or that you're
 authorised to use. Don't upload videos that you didn't make, or use
 content in your videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such
 as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programmes or videos made by
 other users, without the necessary authorisations. Visit our [Copyright
 Centre](//www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/#yt-copyright-education) for more information.
 







![Threats](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-threats.png)



 Threats
 


 Things like predatory behaviour, stalking, threats, harassment,
 intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal
 information and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate
 the Terms of Use are taken very seriously. Anyone caught doing these
 things may be permanently banned from YouTube. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801927)















## We review your reports carefully




 You might not like everything that you see on YouTube. Some of the content
 might offend you. If you think it's inappropriate, locate the flagging
 feature on the video and submit it for review by our YouTube staff. [Find out more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027)




 Our staff review flagged videos 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to determine
 whether they violate our Community Guidelines. When they do, we remove them.
 Sometimes a video doesn't violate our guidelines, but might not be
 appropriate for everyone. These videos may be age-restricted. Accounts are
 penalised for Community Guidelines violations, and serious or repeated
 violations can lead to account termination. If an account is terminated, that
 person won't be allowed to create any new accounts.
 







## Help

## Join in and have fun




 Remember that this is your community. Each and every person on YouTube makes
 the site what it is, so don't be afraid to dig in and get involved.
 



 There's a lot to see here, with lots of people creating amazing stuff â one
 of them might be you! Equipment is getting cheaper and easier to use all the
 time, so dive in and enjoy.
 



 Let people know what you think. Feedback is part of the experience, and when
 done with respect, it can be a great way to make friends, share stories and
 make your time on YouTube richer. So leave comments, rate videos, make your
 own responses to videos that affect you and enter contests that interest you
 â there's a lot going on and a lot of ways to participate.
 



 But most of all, have fun with the site! We hope you'll find something new to
 love as you get to know the community.
