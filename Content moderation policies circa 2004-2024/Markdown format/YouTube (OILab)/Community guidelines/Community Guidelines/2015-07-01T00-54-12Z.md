![Respect the YouTube community](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-communityguidelines-respect.png)


## Respect the YouTube community




 We're not asking for the kind of respect reserved for nuns, the elderly, and
 brain surgeons. Just don't abuse the site. Every cool, new community feature
 on YouTube involves a certain level of trust. We trust you to be responsible,
 and millions of users respect that trust. Please be one of them.
 







## Don't cross the line




 Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble.
 Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look
 for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelinesâjust understand
 them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
 





![Nudity or sexual content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-nudity.png)



 Nudity or sexual content
 


 YouTube is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this
 describes your video, even if it's a video of yourself, don't post it
 on YouTube. Also, be advised that we work closely with law
 enforcement and we report child exploitation. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802002)








![Violent or graphic content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-violence.png)



 Violent or graphic content
 


 It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily
 intended to be shocking, sensational, or disrespectful. If posting
 graphic content in a news or documentary context, please be mindful
 to provide enough information to help people understand what's going
 on in the video. Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of
 violence. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802008)








![Hateful content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-hateful.png)



 Hateful content
 


 Our products are platforms for free expression. But we don't support
 content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or
 groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender,
 age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender
 identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of
 these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but
 if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content
 crosses the line. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939)








![Spam, misleading metadata, and scams](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-spam.png)



 Spam, misleading metadata, and scams
 


 Everyone hates spam. Don't create misleading descriptions, tags,
 titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views. It's not okay to
 post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content,
 including comments and private messages. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973)










![Harmful or dangerous content](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-harmful.png)



 Harmful or dangerous content
 


 Don't post videos that encourage others to do things that might cause
 them to get badly hurt, especially kids. Videos showing such harmful
 or dangerous acts may get age-restricted or removed depending on
 their severity. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964)








![Copyright](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-copyright.png)



 Copyright
 


 Respect copyright. Only upload videos that you made or that you're
 authorized to use. This means don't upload videos you didn't make, or
 use content in your videos that someone else owns the copyright to,
 such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos
 made by other users, without necessary authorizations. Visit our
 [Copyright
 Center](//www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/#yt-copyright-education) for more information.
 







![Threats](/yt/policyandsafety/media/image/yt-policyandsafety-threats.png)



 Threats
 


 Things like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment,
 intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal
 information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate
 the Terms of Use are taken very seriously. Anyone caught doing these
 things may be permanently banned from YouTube. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801927)















## We review your reports carefully




 You might not like everything you see on YouTube. Some of the content might
 offend you. If you think it's inappropriate, locate the flagging feature on
 the video and submit it for review by our YouTube staff. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027)




 Our staff reviews flagged videos 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to determine
 whether they violate our Community Guidelines. When they do, we remove them.
 Sometimes a video doesn't violate our guidelines, but might not be
 appropriate for everyone. These videos may get age-restricted. Accounts are
 penalized for Community Guidelines violations, and serious or repeated
 violations can lead to account termination. If an account is terminated, that
 person won't be allowed to create any new accounts.

## Join in and have fun




 Remember that this is your community. Each and every person on YouTube makes
 the site what it is, so don't be afraid to dig in and get involved.
 



 There's a lot to see here, with lots of folks creating amazing stuffâone of
 them might be you! Equipment is getting cheaper and easier to use all the
 time, so dive in and enjoy.
 



 Let folks know what you think. Feedback is part of the experience, and when
 done with respect, it can be a great way to make friends, share stories, and
 make your time on YouTube richer. So leave comments, rate videos, make your
 own responses to videos that affect you, enter contests of interestâthere's a
 lot going on and a lot of ways to participate.
 



 But most of all, have fun with the site! We hope you'll find something new to
 love as you get to know the community.
