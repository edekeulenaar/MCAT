       # Prevent reuploads of removed videos


**Note:** The feature described in this article isn’t available to all users yet.

If your [copyright-protected](/youtube/answer/2797466) work was posted on YouTube without authorization, you can [submit a copyright takedown request](/youtube/answer/2807622). If you submit a takedown request using our [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form), you can select the option to prevent copies of the videos from being uploaded again.


Selecting this option means YouTube will make its best efforts to automatically prevent the videos you’re requesting for removal from being reuploaded in the future. Keep in mind your takedown request must be found to be complete and valid before any videos are removed or prevented from reupload.




Abuse of this feature may result in you losing the ability to use it for future takedown requests. Misuse of the [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form), such as submitting false information, may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

## FAQs


### If you submitted a takedown request:


## I forgot to select “Prevent copies” when I submitted my takedown request. Can I go back and select it?


If you didn’t initially select the **Prevent copies** option, it’s not possible to select it for a takedown request you already submitted. If you find another video that violates your copyright, use the [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form) to submit a new takedown request. Be sure to select the **Prevent copies** option before you submit.
## Why am I not seeing any videos that were automatically prevented from reupload?



You might not see any videos automatically prevented from reupload if:


* Your takedown request still needs to be approved.
* No copies of the videos from your takedown request have been identified.



## I selected the “Prevent copies” option, but found a copy of my video that wasn’t automatically removed. Why wasn’t it caught?



The **Prevent copies** feature makes its best efforts to prevent copies of removed videos from being reuploaded. The feature takes effect after your takedown request is approved. It’s possible the video you found may have been uploaded before it was approved.


Also, if someone uses a short clip of your video, their video won’t be automatically prevented from upload because our system doesn’t consider it a copy of the removed video.


If you found a reupload of a removed video, you can report it using our [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form). You can also check if the video you found shows up in your [Matches](/youtube/answer/7648743#review_matches) tab and submit a takedown request from there.



## What’s the difference between the “Automatically prevented” column and the “Find matches” column?



The **Automatically prevented** column shows the number of **videos identified as copies** of a removed video. These videos were automatically prevented from appearing on YouTube when a user tried to upload them.


When the **Automatically prevented** status is **Active**, it means YouTube is actively making its best efforts to prevent others from uploading these videos.


The **Find matches** column indicates whether YouTube is searching for **videos identified as potential copies** of a removed video.


When the **Find matches** status is **Active**, it means YouTube is actively searching for potential copies of videos that were removed as a result of your takedown request. These videos weren’t automatically prevented from upload because they weren’t identified as copies, but are considered potential copies.


**Note**: The status of these columns can show as **Inactive** when your takedown request becomes inactive. This can happen if you’ve [retracted](/youtube/answer/2807691) your takedown request or if a video was reinstated as a result of a [counter notification](/youtube/answer/2807684).



## Why isn’t every video that uses my content prevented from upload, including videos that aren’t identified as copies?



Not every use of your content may be infringing on your copyright. There are copyright exceptions like [fair use](/youtube/answer/9783148?hl=en), which could mean a use of your content may be valid.


Our system will show you potential copies of removed videos, but it’s up to you to decide what action to take. If you believe a video violates your copyright, you can submit a [takedown request](http://youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form) for that video.



## Why can’t I find out which individual videos were automatically prevented from upload?



Since these videos weren’t uploaded, there’s no action for you to take. The running count of videos shown in the **Automatically prevented** column will give you an idea of how many copies were prevented from being reuploaded.



## If a copy of a removed video is set as private, will it be prevented from upload?



Regardless of privacy settings, our system will make its best effort to identify copies of removed videos and automatically prevent them from being reuploaded.


For matches that need your review, we’ll only surface videos that are publicly available.



## Will the "Prevent copies" feature automatically prevent videos that include my copyrighted non-video content, such as an image?



Yes, the **Prevent copies** feature can prevent reuploaded videos and surface potential copies if your copyrighted non-video content is located in a video.


Keep in mind, our system only checks videos uploaded to YouTube. If your non-video content is located in a description or thumbnail image, or anywhere that's not in the video itself, our system won't be able to identify it.



## What does it mean to have worldwide exclusive rights to the content I’m requesting the removal of?



Having worldwide exclusive rights means that only you, or the client you represent, control the use and distribution of the content worldwide.



## Why can’t I get access to Content ID?



YouTube’s [copyright management tools](/youtube/answer/9245819) are designed for different types of creators, from occasional uploaders to established media companies. Content ID is available to copyright owners with the most complex copyright management needs.


To qualify for Content ID, copyright owners must own exclusive rights to a substantial body of original material that is frequently uploaded to YouTube. They must also have an advanced knowledge of copyright and the resources necessary to manage Content ID, among other criteria. Learn more about [Content ID eligibility](/youtube/answer/1311402).



## I’m a musician. Can I use this tool to find uploads of my songs?



The **Prevent Copies** feature only prevents new uploads and surfaces potential copies of videos you removed through the [takedown process](/youtube/answer/2807622). If someone uses a portion of your audio, the **Prevent copies** feature won’t surface it.


If you find a video that uses your audio without permission, you can report it using our [webform](https://www.youtube.com/copyright_complaint_form).



### If your video was removed:


## Where can I get more info about why my video was removed?



You can find more info in [YouTube Studio](http://studio.youtube.com):


1. From the left menu, select **Content.**
2. In the **Restrictions** column, hover over **Terms and policies**. The pop-up will show you who issued the takedown request and what video was reported to be infringing.


We’ll also send you an email when your video is removed, which will include this info.



## If one of my videos is prevented from upload, does that mean I get a copyright strike?


No, if a video is automatically prevented from upload, it doesn’t affect your channel and won’t result in [copyright strikes](/youtube/answer/2814000) or [Community Guidelines strikes](/youtube/answer/2802032).
## If I believe my video was incorrectly removed, what can I do?


If you believe your video was incorrectly removed, you can reach out the claimant directly. If you don’t already have the claimant’s contact info, you can email [copyright@youtube.com](mailto:copyright@youtube.com) to get it. Also, some creators list ways they can be contacted [in their channel](/youtube/answer/57955).
