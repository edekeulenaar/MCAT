Suicide & self-injury policy
============================

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, or other mental health issues.

We do not, however, allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users. 

What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------

If you come across content in which someone expresses suicidal thoughts or is engaging in self-harm, please contact local emergency services immediately for help and flag the video to bring it to our immediate attention.

What to do if you need support
------------------------------

If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, or self-harming, know there is help and you’re not alone. Many people turn to suicidal thinking and self-harm as ways to cope with painful emotions. Talking to a specialist can help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Below is a list of suicide prevention organizations dedicated to helping those in need in different countries and regions. The websites [www.befrienders.org](https://www.befrienders.org/) and [suicide.org](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html) also have extensive lists of organizations.

*   Promoting or glorifying suicide
*   Providing instructions on how to self-harm or die by suicide

This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Please note this is not a complete list.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.
