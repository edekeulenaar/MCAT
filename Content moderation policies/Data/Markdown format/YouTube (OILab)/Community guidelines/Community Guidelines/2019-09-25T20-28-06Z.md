# Policies and Safety



 When you use YouTube, you join a community of people from all over the world. Every cool, new community feature on YouTube involves a certain level of trust. Millions of users respect that trust and we trust you to be responsible too. Following the guidelines below helps to keep YouTube fun and enjoyable for everyone.
 



 You might not like everything that you see on YouTube. If you think that content is inappropriate, use the [flagging feature](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027?hl=en_GB) to submit it for review by our YouTube staff. Our staff carefully reviews flagged content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to determine whether there's a violation of our Community Guidelines.

 Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble. Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelinesâjust understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
 









![](/about/static/svgs/icons/policies/sexual-content-icon.svg?cache=d29d44e)



### Nudity or sexual content




 YouTube is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this describes your video, even if it's a video of yourself, don't post it on YouTube. Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.

![](/about/static/svgs/icons/policies/harmful-content-icon.svg?cache=fc914bf)



### Harmful or dangerous content




 Don't post videos that encourage others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially kids. Videos showing such harmful or dangerous acts may be age-restricted or removed depending on their severity.

![](/about/static/svgs/icons/policies/hateful-content-icon.svg?cache=d492697)



### Hateful content




 Our products are platforms for free expression. But we don't support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.

![](/about/static/svgs/icons/policies/violent-icon.svg?cache=aa269c2)

 It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational or gratuitous. If posting graphic content in a news or documentary context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what's going on in the video. Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.
