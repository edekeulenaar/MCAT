       # Vulgar language

Some language may not be appropriate for viewers under 18. We may consider the following factors when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.


* Use of sexually explicit language or narratives
* Use of excessive profanity in your video
* Use of heavy profanity in your video’s title, thumbnail or associated metadata


### Examples


Here are some examples of content which may be age-restricted:


* A video focused on the use of profanities such as a compilation or clip taken out of context
* A video featuring road rage or sustained rant with heavy profanities
* A video with use of heavy profanities during a physical confrontation or to describe acts of violence
