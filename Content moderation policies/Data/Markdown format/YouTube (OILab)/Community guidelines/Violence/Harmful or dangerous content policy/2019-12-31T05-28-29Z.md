Harmful or dangerous content policy
===================================

  
  

YouTube doesn’t allow content that encourages dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death.

If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you find many videos, comments, or a creator's entire channel that you wish to report, visit our [reporting tool](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

*   **Extremely dangerous challenges**: Challenges that pose an imminent risk of physical injury.
*   **Dangerous or threatening pranks**: Pranks that lead victims to fear imminent serious physical danger, or that create serious emotional distress in minors.
*   **Instructions to kill or harm**: Showing viewers how to perform activities meant to kill or maim others. For example, giving instructions to build a bomb meant to injure or kill others.
*   **Hard drug use or creation**: Content that depicts abuse of or giving instructions on how to create hard drugs such as cocaine or opiods. Hard drugs are defined as drugs that can (mostly) lead to physical addiction.
*   **Eating Disorders**: Content that praises, glorifies, or encourages viewers to imitate anorexia or other eating disorders. Eating disorders are characterized by abnormal or disturbed eating habits which negatively affect a person's health (including eating non-food items).
*   **Violent Events**: Promoting or glorifying violent tragedies, such as school shootings.
*   **Instructional theft**: Showing viewers how to steal money or tangible goods.
*   **Hacking**: Demonstrating how to use computers or information technology with the intent to steal credentials, compromise personal data or cause serious harm to others such as (but not limited to) hacking into social media accounts
*   **Promoting dangerous remedies or cures**: Content which claims that harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits.

Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

Don’t post content showing a minor participating in dangerous activity, or encouraging minors to participate in dangerous activities. Never put minors in harmful situations that may lead to injury, including dangerous stunts, dares, or pranks. You can learn more about [Child Safety here](/youtube/answer/2801999).

Age-restricted content
----------------------

We may consider the following factors when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

*   Whether the act in question could lead to serious injury or death
*   Whether the individuals participating in the act are trained professionals taking precautions to prevent injury.
*   Whether minors could easily imitate the act
*   Whether the content could be used to commit serious acts of violence
*   Whether the upload is educational, documentary, scientific or artistic in nature
*   Whether there's any commentary discouraging the act
*   Whether the viewer can tell if it's real or fake

**Examples of age-restricted content**

*    A video about fake harmful pranks that seems so real that viewers can't tell the difference
*   A reaction video to a dangerous challenge without any commentary discouraging the challenge

We might allow videos that depict dangerous acts iIf they’re meant to be educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA). For example, a news piece on the dangers of choking games would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context from the same documentary might not be.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.
