         # Counterfeit

Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods in its products, including YouTube. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.


Channels that promote or sell counterfeit goods may be terminated.


If you believe a video or channel is selling or promoting counterfeit goods, you may file a Counterfeit complaint through our online form.
