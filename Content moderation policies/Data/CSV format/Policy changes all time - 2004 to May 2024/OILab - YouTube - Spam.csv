Medical misinformation policy
=============================
YouTube doesn't allow content that poses a serious risk of egregious harm by spreading medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities’ (LHAs) or the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance about specific health conditions and substances. This policy includes the following categories:
*   Prevention misinformation 
*   Treatment misinformation 
*   Denial misinformation
**Note:** YouTube’s medical misinformation policies are subject to change in response to changes to guidance from health authorities or WHO. There may be a delay between new LHAs/WHO guidance and policy updates, and our policies may not cover all LHA/WHO guidance related to specific health conditions and substances.
**What this policy means for you**
----------------------------------
**Don’t post content on YouTube if it includes any of the following:**
**Prevention misinformation:** We do not allow content that promotes information that contradicts health authority guidance on the prevention or transmission of specific health conditions, or on the safety, efficacy or ingredients of currently approved and administered vaccines.
**Treatment misinformation:** We do not allow content that promotes information that contradicts health authority guidance on treatments for specific health conditions, including promotion of specific harmful substances or practices that have not been approved by local health authorities or the World Health Organization as safe or effective, or that have been confirmed to cause severe harm.
**Denial misinformation:** We do not allow content that denies the existence of specific health conditions.
These policies apply to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content.

**Educational, documentary, scientific or artistic content**
------------------------------------------------------------
We may allow content that violates the misinformation policies noted on this page if that content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views from local health authorities or medical experts. We may also make exceptions if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies. We may also make exceptions for content discussing the results of a specific medical study, or showing an open public forum, like a protest or public hearing, provided the content does not aim to promote misinformation that violates our policies.
YouTube also believes people should be able to share their own experiences, including personal experiences with vaccinations, for example. This means we may make exceptions for content in which creators describe firsthand experiences from themselves or their family. At the same time, we recognize there is a difference between sharing personal experiences and promoting misinformation. To address this balance, we will still remove content or channels if they include other policy violations or demonstrate a pattern of promoting medical misinformation.
**What happens if content violates this policy**
------------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. As we ramp up our enforcement we'll remove violative videos without giving a strike. We will begin issuing strikes for new content uploaded after Inauguration Day, January 20, 2021. [Learn more](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election).
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content

*   **Presidential Election Integrity**: Content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of any past U.S. presidential election (Note: this applies to elections in the United States only). For the U.S. 2020 presidential election, this applies to content uploaded on or after December 9, 2020.

    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
*   **Presidential Election Integrity**: Content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of any past U.S. presidential election (Note: this applies to elections in the United States only). For the U.S. 2020 presidential election, this applies to content uploaded on or after December 9, 2020.
*   **Video Spam**: Content that is excessively posted, repetitive, or untargeted and does one or more of the following:
    *   Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.
    *   Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.
    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.
*   **Misleading Metadata or Thumbnails**: Using the title, thumbnails, description, or tags to trick users into believing the content is something it is not.
*   **Manipulated Media**: Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.
*   **Scams**: Content offering cash gifts, “get rich quick” schemes, or pyramid schemes (sending money without a tangible product in a pyramid structure).
*   **Voter Suppression**: Content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting.
*   **Suppression of Census Participation**: Content aiming to mislead participants about the time, means or eligibility requirements for participating in a census. 
    
*   **Candidate** **Eligibility**: Content that advances false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements for current political candidates and sitting elected government officials to serve in office. Eligibility requirements considered are based on applicable national law, and include age, citizenship, or vital status.
*   **Incitement to interfere with democratic processes**: content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes, such as obstructing or interrupting voting procedures.
*   **Distribution of hacked materials**: content that contains hacked information, the disclosure of which may interfere with democratic processes, such as elections and censuses.
*   **Incentivization Spam**: Content that sells engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, or any other metric on YouTube. This also includes content where the only purpose is to boost subscribers, views, or other metrics (e.g. offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel solely in exchange for them subscribing to your channel, also known as ""Sub4Sub"" content).
*   **Comments Spam**: Comments where the sole purpose is to gather personal information from viewers, misleadingly drive viewers off YouTube, or perform any of the prohibited behaviors noted above.
*   **Repetitive comments**: Leaving large amounts of identical, untargeted or repetitive comments.
*   **Live Stream Abuse**: Live streams intended to stream content that belongs to somebody else and are not corrected following repeated warnings of possible abuse. Live streams should be actively monitored by the channel owner, and any potential issues should be corrected in a timely manner.
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
**Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment.

We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
*   **Presidential Election Integrity**: Content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of any past U.S. presidential election (Note: this applies to elections in the United States only). For the U.S. 2020 presidential election, this applies to content uploaded on or after December 9, 2020.
*   **Video Spam**: Content that is excessively posted, repetitive, or untargeted and does one or more of the following:
    *   Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.
    *   Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.
    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.
*   **Misleading Metadata or Thumbnails**: Using the title, thumbnails, description, or tags to trick users into believing the content is something it is not.

Spam, deceptive practices & scams policies
==========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

    *   Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.
    *   Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.
    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.
*   **Misleading Metadata or Thumbnails**: Using the title, thumbnails, description, or tags to trick users into believing the content is something it is not.

Spam, deceptive practices, & scams policies
===========================================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
On December 9, we started applying our Presidential Election Integrity policy (below) to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, meaning we remove content that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election uploaded on or after December 9. We have begun issuing strikes for new content that violates the policy uploaded on or after January 7, 2021.
YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
*   **Presidential Election Integrity**: Content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of any past U.S. presidential election (Note: this applies to elections in the United States only). For the U.S. 2020 presidential election, this applies to content uploaded on or after December 9, 2020.

    *   Promises viewers they'll see something but instead directs them off site.
    *   Gets clicks, views, or traffic off YouTube by promising viewers that they’ll make money fast.
    *   Sends audiences to sites that spread malware, try to gather personal information, or other sites that have a negative impact.

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metric either through the use of automatic systems or by serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Additionally, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to interact with content free of coercion or deception, or where the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain. 
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel page
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metric either through the use of automatic systems or by serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Additionally, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to interact with content free of coercion or deception, or where the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain. 
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel page
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation.

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days.

If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation.

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account.

* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority – and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **Please take the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metric either through the use of automatic systems or by serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Additionally, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to interact with content free of coercion or deception, or where the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain. 
If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).

Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

       # Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.
Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.
**Important:** If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.
We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
## What this policy means for you
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
	+ **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
## How engagement is measured
Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:
* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)
The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.
Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Suspended accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.
If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.
## Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
## What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we may issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about [channel or account terminations here](/youtube/answer/2802168).

Impersonation policy
====================
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. **T****ake the time to carefully read the policy below**. You can also check out [this page](/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.
Content intended to impersonate a person or channel is not allowed on YouTube. YouTube also enforces trademark holder rights. When a channel, or content in the channel, causes confusion about the source of goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.
If you see content that violates this policy, [report it](/youtube/answer/2802027).
*   If you feel that yours or another creator's channel is being impersonated, you can [report the channel](/youtube/answer/2802027).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
#### If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below. 
*   **Channel impersonation:** A channel that copies another channel's profile, background, or overall look and feel in such a way that makes it look like someone else's channel. The channel does not have to be 100% identical, as long as the intent is clear to copy the other channel.
*   **Personal impersonation:** Content intended to look like someone else is posting it.
If you operate a fan channel, make sure you state so explicitly in your channel name or [handle](/youtube/answer/11585688). It should be obvious to your viewers that your channel doesn't represent the original creator, artist or entity your channel is celebrating.
Examples
--------
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.
*   Channels with the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image as another channel, with the only difference being a space inserted into the name or a zero replacing the letter O.
*   Using someone else's real name, user name, image, brand, logo, or other personal information to trick people into believing you are that person. 
*   Setting up a channel using the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image of a person, and then pretending that person is posting content to the channel.
*   Setting up a channel using the name and image of a person, and then posting comments on other channels as if they were posted by the person.
*   Channels claiming to be a 'fan account' in the channel description, but not stating so clearly in the channel name or handle, or posing as another’s channel and reuploading their content.
*   Channels impersonating an existing news channel.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we may terminate your channel or account. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).

This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in a video, and other forms of link-sharing.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. [Advertiser-friendly content guidelines](/youtube/answer/6162278) also apply. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. [Learn more about our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032).
We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. [Learn more about channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168).

*   Content that contains external links to material that would violate our policies and can cause a serious risk of egregious harm, like misleading or deceptive content relating to an election, hate speech targeting protected groups, or harassment targeting election workers, candidates, or voters. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in a video, and other forms of link-sharing.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. [Advertiser-friendly content guidelines](/youtube/answer/6162278) also apply.

Elections misinformation policies
=================================
On June 2, 2023, we updated how this policy applies to past US election outcomes. Learn more in our [blog](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/us-election-misinformation-update-2023/).
Certain types of misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm are not allowed on YouTube. This includes certain types of misinformation that can cause real-world harm, like certain types of technically manipulated content, and content interfering with democratic processes.
[Elections Misinformation Policy: YouTube Community Guidelines](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpR7CR8D8LE)
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments from a single channel that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
### **If you're posting content**
These policies prohibit certain types of content relating to free and fair democratic elections. Don’t post elections-related content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
*   **Voter suppression:** Content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting.
*   **Candidate eligibility:** Content that advances false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements for current political candidates and sitting elected government officials to serve in office. Eligibility requirements considered are based on applicable national law, and include age, citizenship, or vital status.
*   **Incitement to interfere with democratic processes:** Content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes. This includes obstructing or interrupting voting procedures.
*   **Election integrity:** Content advancing false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in certain past elections to determine heads of government. Or, content that claims that the certified results of those elections were false. This policy currently applies to:
    *   The 2021 German federal election
    *   The 2014, 2018, and 2022 Brazilian Presidential elections
Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
Examples
--------
The following types of content are not allowed on YouTube. This isn't a complete list.
Voter suppression
*   Telling viewers they can vote through inaccurate methods like texting their vote to a particular number.
*   Giving made up voter eligibility requirements like saying that a particular election is only open to voters over 50 years old.
*   Telling viewers an incorrect voting date.
*   Claiming that a voter’s political party affiliation is visible on a vote-by-mail envelope.
*   False claims that non-citizen voting has determined the outcome of past elections.
*   False claims that Brazilian electronic voting machines have been hacked in the past to change an individual’s vote.
Candidate eligibility
*   Claims that a candidate or sitting government official is not eligible to hold office based on false info about the age required to hold office in that country/region.
*   Claims that a candidate or sitting government official is not eligible to hold office based on false info about citizenship status requirements to hold office in that country/region.
*   Claims that a candidate or sitting government official is ineligible for office based on false claims that they’re deceased, not old enough or otherwise do not meet eligibility requirements.
Incitement to interfere with democratic processes
*   Telling viewers to create long voting lines with the purpose of making it harder for others to vote.
*   Telling viewers to hack government websites to delay the release of elections results.
*   Telling viewers to incite physical conflict with election officials, voters, candidates, or other individuals at polling locations to deter voting.
Election integrity
*   Content advancing false claims that widespread fraud, error, or glitches changed the outcome of the German parliamentary (Bundestag) elections, delegitimizes the formation of the new government or the election and appointment of the next German Chancellor.
*   False claims that widespread fraud, error, or glitches changed the outcome of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election.  
Educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content
---------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate this policy is allowed to stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views, or if the content condemns, disputes, or satirizes misinformation that violates our policies. [Learn about how YouTube evaluates EDSA content](/youtube/answer/6345162).
### Related policies
Elections-related content is also subject to other Community Guidelines. This could include, for example:
*   Content that threatens individuals such as election workers, candidates, or voters isn’t allowed under our [Harassment & cyberbullying policies](/youtube/answer/2802268).
*   Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users - usually beyond clips taken out of context - and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm isn’t allowed under our [Misinformation policies](/youtube/answer/10834785). For example, footage that has been technically manipulated to make a candidate for public office falsely claim they’re dropping out of the race.
*   Content that may pose a serious risk of egregious harm by falsely claiming that old footage from a past event is from a current event isn’t allowed under our [Misinformation policies](/youtube/answer/10834785). For example, a video that shows a head of state condoning a violent conflict that he or she never actually condoned.
*   Content that encourages others to commit violent acts, including acts targeting election workers, candidates, or voters isn’t allowed under our [Violent or graphic content policies](/youtube/answer/2802008).
*   Content that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes isn’t allowed under our [Hate speech policies](/youtube/answer/2801939). This includes, for example, content that shows a political rally attendee dehumanizing a group based on a protected attribute, such as race, religion, or sexual orientation.
*   Content that’s intended to impersonate a person or channel, such as a political candidate or their political party, isn’t allowed under our [Impersonation policy](/youtube/answer/2801947).
*   Content that contains external links to material that would violate our policies and can cause a serious risk of egregious harm, like misleading or deceptive content relating to an election, hate speech targeting protected groups, or harassment targeting election workers, candidates, or voters. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in a video, and other forms of link-sharing.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. [Advertiser-friendly content guidelines](/youtube/answer/6162278) also apply. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
### **If you're posting content**

*   **Voter suppression:** Content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting.
*   **Candidate eligibility:** Content that advances false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements for current political candidates and sitting elected government officials to serve in office. Eligibility requirements considered are based on applicable national law, and include age, citizenship, or vital status.
*   **Incitement to interfere with democratic processes:** Content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes. This includes obstructing or interrupting voting procedures.
*   **Distribution of hacked materials:** Content that contains hacked info, the disclosure of which may interfere with democratic processes.

    *   Any past U.S. Presidential election
    *   The 2021 German federal election
Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.
Examples
--------
The following types of content are not allowed on YouTube. This isn't a complete list.

*   Claiming that a voter’s  political party affiliation is visible on a vote-by-mail envelope.
*   False claims that non-citizen voting has determined the outcome of past elections.

*   Claims that a candidate or sitting government official is not eligible to hold office based on false info about citizenship status requirements to hold office in that country/region.
*   Claims that a candidate or sitting government official is ineligible for office based on false claims that they’re deceased, not old enough or otherwise do not meet eligibility requirements.

We may allow content that violates the election integrity policy noted on this page if the content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a free pass to promote misinformation.

Elections misinformation policies
=================================
Certain types of misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm are not allowed on YouTube. This includes certain types of misinformation that can cause real-world harm, like certain types of technically manipulated content, and content interfering with democratic processes.
[Elections Misinformation Policy: YouTube Community Guidelines](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpR7CR8D8LE)
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](/youtube/answer/2802027).

What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
### **If you're posting content**
These policies prohibit certain types of content relating to free and fair democratic elections. Don’t post elections-related content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.
*   **Voter suppression:** Content aiming to mislead voters about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements for voting, or false claims that could materially discourage voting.
*   **Candidate eligibility:** Content that advances false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements for current political candidates and sitting elected government officials to serve in office. Eligibility requirements considered are based on applicable national law, and include age, citizenship, or vital status.
*   **Incitement to interfere with democratic processes:** Content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes. This includes obstructing or interrupting voting procedures.
*   **Distribution of hacked materials:** Content that contains hacked info, the disclosure of which may interfere with democratic processes.
*   **Election integrity:** Content advancing false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in certain past elections to determine heads of government. Or, content that claims that the certified results of those elections were false. This policy currently applies to:
    *   Any past U.S. Presidential election
    *   The 2021 German federal election
    *   The 2014, 2018, and 2022 Brazilian Presidential elections
Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

We may allow content that violates the election integrity policy noted on this page if the content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views, or if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel.

Misinformation policies
=======================
Certain types of misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm are not allowed on YouTube. This includes certain types of misinformation that can cause real-world harm, like promoting harmful remedies or treatments, certain types of technically manipulated content, or content interfering with democratic processes.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).
What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------
### **If you're posting content**
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions below.
*   **Suppression of census participation:** Content aiming to mislead census participants about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements of the census, or false claims that could materially discourage census participation.
*   **Manipulated content:** Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.
*   **Misattributed content:** Content that may pose a serious risk of egregious harm by falsely claiming that old footage from a past event is from a current event.
*   **Promoting dangerous remedies, cures, or substances:** Content that promotes harmful substances, treatments, or substances that present an inherent risk of severe bodily harm or death.
*   **Contradicting expert consensus on certain safe medical practices:** Content that contradicts local health authorities’ or WHO guidance on certain safe medical practices.

*   Video content that has been technically manipulated (beyond clips taken out of context) to fabricate events where there’s a serious risk of egregious harm.
Misattributed content
*   Content inaccurately presented as documenting human rights abuses in a specific location that is actually content from another location or event.  
*   Content showing a military crackdown on protesters with false claims that the content is from a current event, when the footage is actually several years old.

    *   Chemical and surgical abortion methods deemed safe by health authorities
*   Promotion of alternative health practices deemed unsafe by local health authorities or the WHO in the following areas:

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate these policies. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.
Educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content
---------------------------------------------------------
We may allow content that violates the misinformation policies noted on this page if that content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views from local health authorities or medical experts. We may also make exceptions if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies.
What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your channel. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your channel. If you get 3 strikes, your channel will be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](/youtube/answer/2802032).
